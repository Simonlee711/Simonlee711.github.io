Unfortunately, this month I am breaking structure and tradition once again. Instead of highlighting three highlights, I thought it would be more pertinent to discuss my current struggle, which involves an inverse happiness problem.

# Inverse Happiness

Currently, I find myself at an equilibrium in my lifeâ€”not necessarily happy, but not unhappy either. It's a peculiar sensation largely governed by my dual existence: one professional and one personal. Lately, my professional life has been thriving. I received my first conference paper acceptance at ICML, secured a research fellowship, and have made valuable connections with faculty and other Ph.D. students that I admire. These accomplishments indicate that this aspect of my life is progressing well. However, my personal life has markedly suffered. I broke up with my girlfriend, lost contact with many close friends I made this year, and overall, things have been spiraling downward due to my inability to balance both aspects of my life.

In my last post, I mentioned that balance was essential, and I acknowledged my lack of it. Yet, I'm now entering this strange state of equilibrium where my feelings are ambiguous. It's wonderful to have success in my academic pursuits, considering I spend 60-70 hours a week working. However, I am uncertain about how to balance these positive developments with the losses I've recently experienced. This situation seems unsustainable, and I think I might be trying to suppress these mixed emotions by immersing myself further in work. Thus, I'm left unsure of my feelings, simply hoping that things will improve moving forward.
