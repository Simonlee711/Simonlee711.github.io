With the year wrapping up real soon, the winter time depression was really kicking in. After finally making it through a semester in Switzerland, I had to look myself in the mirror and reflect where I am in my personal life. School wasn't really what I expected it to be, I had preserved a relationship which I should have left behind months ago, and things were trending in the wrong direction. However, this is the expectation of a normal life and the principles of duality. If we are able to experience life peaking moments, we should equally expect to experience times of being lost once in a while. In a mental sense, I felt sort of lost for once in my life. The ambitious, optimistic kid was drowning inside of me and it was being filled with sadness and clouded judgement. However bad things that happen, can always be seen in a good light in dealing with future tough realities, and I usually tell myself that this was how things were meant to be for me to get to the point I want to get to. Although 2022 was ending on a low note, I think I can still stand here today proclaiming that this was still the best year of my life. After a terrible outing years prior due to COVID-19, I was able to drag myself out of a worse state and build up a community I was proud of. On top of that, I got to try so many new things that I would've been scared to try at a younger age. 

In reality I like to think that I took a massive risk this year. Risks are usually more detrimentel than favorable but if things do workout, the payout is immense. But even though this particular situation didn't work out for me, I think its still worth mentioning that I would not have changed anything in the world. Hardships made me grow as a person, and I think in the longrun, alot of these one of a kind stories will tell great stories. I mean who in the world ever got to ride the boat just to get to school. And while the beginning of this blog has shined a dim light so far, I do see hope for an even better year to come. With my time in Switzerland coming to an end, I in turn have found in opportunity back in the states that will allow me to live in the East Coast in the city of Boston. There I hope to regain the foundations of who I am, while beginning a new chapter in my life which entails of beginning my professional career. I am sure adapting to this new situation will bring more challenges, but more than anything I am just happy to be home in the country I now know I belong in.

# Top Three Moments of the Month

### 1. Hard Truths

The first moment of the month involves a tough truth I had to learn. Months ago, I had planned this trip to New York City, after being separated from my ex-girlfriend Noelle Wheeler for several months. The two of us stayed in contact to some extent, and I thought this was a friendship that could last forever even though we were no longer boyfriend and girlfriend. 

### 2. NYC

### 3. Dropping Out & Starting Work


# One thing I learned this Month

### The Only Way is Up

With my soul partially crushed and an emptiness in my heart, I think it is fair to say that this might be a rock bottom moment. However the best part about being or feeling at the bottom of the totum pole is that there is only one direction you can go from here and that is up. Hitting rock bottom can serve as a profound turning point in one's life. It's in those moments of immense challenge and adversity that we are compelled to confront our limitations and reassess our path. Rock bottom, though painful and humbling, presents an opportunity for growth and transformation. When we have lost what we thought was solid ground, we become more receptive to change and more open to rebuilding. From the depths of despair, there emerges a resilience and determination that propels us upward. The experience of hitting rock bottom can be a catalyst for reevaluating our values, priorities, and goals, guiding us towards a renewed sense of purpose and a profound understanding that the only way to go from there is up. I therefore look forward to the upcoming year and see where my life takes me from year. Peace out 2022 and Hello 2023.
