On the weekends, I have really enjoyed going to Harvard square to go read some of their *Harvard Business Review* books. The typical audience for these books are meant for people in business, and while I have no particular interest in being one at this time, I have found these books to be fascinating reads. With the Ivy league schools wanting to produce some of the leaders of tomorrow, I find it to be extremely engaging on how this school empowers their audience. They have a series of books called the *Harvard Business Review Essential Reads*, and this weekend I stumbled across the *Managing youself Vol. 2* version. This book briefly talks about finding purpose in your work, and how important it is to find what you are passionate about while properly impacting the people around you. They begin the book with a powerful quote from Mark Twain: *The two most important days in your life are the day you are born and the day you find out why.* In its introduction chapter, they have this exercise to set off some of the themes and I thought this week would be an interesting time to participate in this activity. Therefore the structure of this weeks blog is Q&A where I answer some of the prompts from this book.
