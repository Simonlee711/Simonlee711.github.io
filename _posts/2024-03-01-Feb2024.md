# Top Three Highlights of the Month

February flew by for me in a flash. It was a busy period in my life, due to the added pressure I place on myself. Being busy has always been more pleasant for me than letting the minutes tick by in a day, and as a result, it went by really quickly. February featured the hardest part of the quarter, where we were slowly getting into an even more intense crunch time since the quarter was nearly over. However, because I kept busy, I have also been super productive, which has always been a rewarding experience. Therefore, this month marked an acceptance of the role I picked up and marks a year since I was admitted into a Ph.D. program. There are many myths and truths about what life as a Ph.D. student is like, and I'd love to share my thoughts regarding these matters. However, we can begin with two tweets that highlight the duality of academia and the dark truth behind them:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Future grad students: if youâ€™re really interested in science, you will go to any university that accepts you (forgetting about any rejections from the prestigious ones) and you will do great science there and you will make our world better. <a href="https://twitter.com/ItaiYanai/status/1763204520799011302">https://twitter.com/ItaiYanai/status/1763204520799011302</a> <a href="https://t.co/gcNLJoJ0Gn">pic.twitter.com/gcNLJoJ0Gn</a></p>&mdash; Michael Rose (@mmistakes) <a href="https://twitter.com/ItaiYanai/status/1763204520799011302">February 4, 2023</a></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">And you will be underpaid the entire time, while watching your friends succeed outside academia. 
You will routinely work ungodly hours resulting in a decline in relationships.
You will also struggle to land jobs and grants, putting you in an immense amount of stress.
Good luck. <a href="https://twitter.com/yourneedler/status/1763225097513382107">https://twitter.com/yourneedler/status/1763225097513382107</a> <a href="https://t.co/gcNLJoJ0Gn">pic.twitter.com/gcNLJoJ0Gn</a></p>&mdash; Michael Rose (@mmistakes) <a href="https://twitter.com/yourneedler/status/1763225097513382107">February 4, 2023</a></blockquote>

Both these quotes define the duality of a Ph.D. and even with less than a years experience I can relate to both. The passion for developing and contributing to the field of science comes at the expense of inhumane hours due to pressure deadlines and high expectations from going to a prestigious university. However, it brings me peace that 2% of the world is empathetic to this feeling because these people are truly the people changing the world. Therefore busy is not necessarily bad but finding a balance is what will ultimatley bring the success and happiness for myself.

### 1. What's Motivating Me

Motivation is an important aspect of every human beings lives. It is what allows us to continue moving forward and not going through the motions of life. Everyday I wake up, I remind myself that "it's another day in paradise" because for all the hardship that I face academically, many people would kill to be in the same position as I am. Therefore expectations and presentation has been an important factor of what is keeping me going on this journey in life. This whole conversation about personal motives and what brought us to do this strenuous degree came at a dinner I had with Timothy Lindsey and Zach Schlamowitz, two of my fellow friends who are also in a Ph.D. We talked about how things were going thus far and I was prompted to ask them what kept them going. Both their answers were much more impressive than mine in the sense that they were representing someone more than just themselves. Tim was saying that he is representing Biola University and being one of the only people from that school to ever apply to a Ph.D. and having the school's president write him a letter of recommendation to represent the little chances he felt he had coming in. Zach also had a similar motivation where he spoke about how a lot of people look up to him and think he is successful due to his academic success so he has to do his part in elevating his performance. This prompted me to rethink my current motives and I therefore wanted to share in this blog what those were.
