# Top Three Highlights of the Month

February for me went by in a flash. It was a busy time in my life due to the added pressure I add to myself. Being busy has always been more pleasant than letting the minutes tick by in a day and as a result it went by really fast. February featured the hardest part of the quarter where we are slowly getting into an even worse crunch time since the quarter was nearly over. However because I am kept busy, I have equally been super productive which has always been a rewarding experience. Therefore this month was an acceptance of the role I picked up and marks a year since I was admitted into a Ph.D. program. There have been lots of myths and truths about what life as a Ph.D. student is and I'd love to share all my thoughts regarding these things. However we can begin with two tweets that mark the duality of academia and the dark truth behind them:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Future grad students: if youâ€™re really interested in science, you will go to any university that accepts you (forgetting about any rejections from the prestigious ones) and you will do great science there and you will make our world better. <a href="https://twitter.com/ItaiYanai/status/1763204520799011302">https://twitter.com/ItaiYanai/status/1763204520799011302</a> <a href="https://t.co/gcNLJoJ0Gn">pic.twitter.com/gcNLJoJ0Gn</a></p>&mdash; Michael Rose (@mmistakes) <a href="https://twitter.com/latestinspace/status/1621881616078356481?lang=en">February 4, 2023</a></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">And you will be underpaid the entire time, while watching your friends succeed outside academia. 
You will routinely work ungodly hours resulting in a decline in relationships.
You will also struggle to land jobs and grants, putting you in an immense amount of stress.
Good luck. <a href="https://twitter.com/yourneedler/status/1763225097513382107">https://twitter.com/yourneedler/status/1763225097513382107</a> <a href="https://t.co/gcNLJoJ0Gn">pic.twitter.com/gcNLJoJ0Gn</a></p>&mdash; Michael Rose (@mmistakes) <a href="https://twitter.com/latestinspace/status/1621881616078356481?lang=en">February 4, 2023</a></blockquote>
