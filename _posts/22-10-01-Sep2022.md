The power of now is an undeniable force that reminds us of the precious nature of the present moment. In a world dominated by constant distractions and future-oriented anxieties, embracing the power of now is an art that encourages us to fully immerse ourselves in the present, without being tethered to the regrets of the past or the uncertainties of the future. It is a lifestyle that champions living in the moment, extracting the maximum depth and richness from each passing second.

There is a certain magic to experiencing life in real-time. Some opportunities are fleeting, and their true essence can only be captured when seized immediately. The power of now invites us to fully engage with our surroundings, relationships, and activities, thereby opening ourselves up to experiences that may never come our way again. Whether it's savoring the taste of a new dish, embracing a spontaneous adventure, or sharing an unfiltered moment with loved ones, the power of now urges us to let go of hesitation and dive headfirst into life's vibrant tapestry.

Regret often stems from moments where we hesitated, where we held back due to fear or uncertainty. Embracing the power of now means making decisions with conviction and fully committing to them. By doing so, we eliminate the "what-ifs" and pave the way for a life marked by authenticity and fulfillment. It's about realizing that the future is uncertain, and our past is unchangeable, but the present offers a canvas on which we can paint the strokes of our existence with vibrancy and purpose.

Adopting the power of now as a lifestyle requires a shift in perspective. It means reprogramming our minds to value the present over an elusive future. This mindset frees us from the shackles of regret, enabling us to lead a life driven by passion and spontaneity. It empowers us to create lasting memories, forge deep connections, and appreciate the beauty that exists in every fleeting moment. By living in the now, we acknowledge that life is a collection of these moments, and when we string them together, we create a life that's as vibrant and meaningful as it can possibly be.

*But why is this even worth bringing up?*

In the month of September, I finally found myself with some much-needed free time after months of relentless hard work. This break was a rare luxury that prompted deep reflection on how to best utilize this newfound freedom. As the days gradually unfolded with leisure at hand, it dawned on me that there were numerous endeavors I should strive to undertake before this privilege slips away. Free time, a precious and often scarce resource, presents a distinctive window to engage in activities and pursuits that tend to be overshadowed by the hustle of daily life. It stands as a blank canvas upon which to explore passions, venture into uncharted territories, and foster personal development. Amidst the constant rush of modern existence, the value of free time lies in its capacity to empower individuals to prioritize pursuits that often take a backseat in the face of responsibilities and obligations.

Consequently, throughout this month, I seized the opportunity to immerse myself in the new environment surrounding me. Spontaneous trips were booked, leading me to discover captivating destinations across Europe. The notion that these years of proximity to such experiences were limited spurred a sense of urgency and excitement. This mindset continued to drive my actions throughout September. The month turned into an exhilarating adventure, marked by extensive travel and a fervent pursuit of unique opportunities in this unexplored continent. It is my pleasure to share a glimpse of these transformative moments with all of you.

# Top Three Highlights of the Month

### 1. Simon in Paris

One way that brought comfort into my new life in Europe was through watching the hit show "Emily in Paris." The series revolves around Emily Cooper, portrayed by Lily Collins, who moves from Chicago to Paris for a marketing position. Combining comedy and drama, the show captures fashion, romance, and the contrast between American and French cultures. As we follow Emily's journey through work, friendships, and love, the series delves into the challenges of adapting to a foreign city, set against the vibrant backdrop of Paris. This show provided me solace due to its glamorous portrayal of Parisian life, trendy aesthetics, and its ability to initiate conversations about cultural disparities and the allure of global settings. These themes resonated with me, helping me realize that my initial sentiments were part of an ongoing process of adjusting to a new culture.

Moving on, this month held my own "Emily in Paris" moment, as I ventured to my most cherished city in the world. Paris, often known as the "City of Light" or the "City of Love," occupies a special place in the hearts of many as one of the world's most magnificent cities. Its allure is a fusion of timeless charm and contemporary dynamism. Iconic landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, Louvre Museum, and Notre-Dame Cathedral stand as symbols of its profound history and cultural importance. Whether strolling along the picturesque banks of the Seine River or wandering through charming streets adorned with cafés and boutiques, the city exudes a palpable blend of romance and artistic expression that permeates its atmosphere.

Paris boasts a world-class culinary scene that celebrates exquisite cuisine, from delicate pastries to gourmet dining experiences. The city's artistic heritage, nurtured by luminaries like Hemingway, Picasso, and Monet, continues to inspire creativity and innovation. The Parisian lifestyle embodies a balance of work and leisure, where a leisurely pace of life invites indulgence in intellectual pursuits, cultural events, and leisurely café conversations. The convergence of history, art, fashion, and gastronomy, all within an enchanting urban landscape, makes Paris an unparalleled destination that captures the hearts of travelers and dreamers from around the globe.

Before this trip, I had visited Paris on two other occasions, and I was eager to experience this visit as less of a tourist and more as an opportunity to truly appreciate the city. Notable moments from this trip included visiting new attractions such as the Catacombs of Paris, an underground ossuary containing the remains of millions of people, the ethereal Gothic beauty of Sainte-Chapelle with its stunning stained glass windows, sampling the winner of the Best Croissants in Paris competition, and simply basking in the atmosphere of random parks while listening to elegant street music. Choosing to come to Paris proved to be a wonderful decision, especially after a relatively stressful month due to housing concerns. While Paris is distinct from Lausanne, being here reinforced my appreciation for living in Europe. The European aesthetic, with its blend of historical charm and architectural elegance, is epitomized by picturesque buildings characterized by intricate details, colorful facades, and cozy windows adorned with flower boxes. From the cobblestone alleys of Paris to the architecture that resonates with centuries-old craftsmanship, the European aesthetic kindles a profound love affair with its utterly irresistible and charming buildings.

During my trip, there were moments when I would purchase a few beers and a crepe from a street vendor, find a spot in front of the Eiffel Tower, and simply gaze into the distance as the hours slowly passed. With every change of the hour, a minute-long light show would grace the scene, adding a touch of magic to the Parisian nights that brought me a sense of tranquility. Yet, I must admit, there were moments of profound loneliness as well. This feeling was amplified after months of being surrounded by people, and the realization that I was now often dining at restaurants by myself. Despite these occasional pangs of loneliness, my hopes remained high as I embarked on experiences like trying one of Paris's delicacies—Escargot—at one of the city's most renowned streets. Surprisingly, eating snails didn't feel much different from indulging in seafood, and I had no qualms about savoring this seemingly slimy creature. After dinners, I would leisurely stroll through the cityscape, marveling at its extraordinary beauty. This elegant escapade was truly a much-needed respite, and for the most part, this trip was turning out to be a wonderful journey.

 This trip, though mostly wonderful, had two defining moments that stood out. The European summer weather is infamous for its unpredictable behavior—shifting abruptly from blazing sun and soaring temperatures to sudden, torrential downpours. This ever-changing climate creates an atmosphere of charming chaos, demanding locals and tourists alike to swiftly transition from beach attire to umbrellas in mere moments. One day, as I was exploring the city, a downpour suddenly disrupted my plans. It was as if the rain had decided to "rain on my parade." Stranded far from my hostel, I found myself drenched within minutes, unsure of what to do. Fortunately, the rainstorm lasted only about 20 minutes, transforming into an elegant and beautiful scene shortly after. I decided to stick around the area to witness the sunset, though dealing with the unexpected rain was a bit of a hassle.

That same night, just as I was heading home, I found myself confronted by two unfamiliar men. As it turned out, these individuals were thieves and had their eyes on the fake "gold" chain I was wearing. Unaware of their intentions at the time, one of the men approached me, hurling a stream of American insults in my direction. Suddenly, he used his lit cigarette to burn my forearm, causing the skin to sizzle and leaving a lasting mark. This was a clever diversion tactic, as the other man swiftly snatched the chain from my neck, and they quickly fled the scene. Some onlookers, including street vendors, tried to help me afterward, and I was appreciative of their concern. While still processing the shocking encounter, I realized that the sentimental chain, a graduation gift from my friend Alex Pavy from our vintage market outing, had vanished. It left me feeling deeply saddened, adding to the scars both physical and emotional from those events. Despite this unsettling incident, the overall trip remained positive, and I cherished the opportunity to enjoy my favorite city once again. This experience taught me a valuable lesson: to avoid wearing jewelry when traveling to prevent such situations. With that, I bid farewell on a positive note, expressing gratitude to Paris and eagerly anticipating a return to its beautiful streets in the near future.

### 2. Passing Out at Clairo's Concert

The second highlight was a mixture of a highlight and a lowlight based on what you've seen by the title alone. In the month of September, Clairo one of my favorite artists was on her Europe tour and there was no way I was going to miss out on this opportunity.
