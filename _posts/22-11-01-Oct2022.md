At last, we had hit the moment I had been waiting for months. This momentous event was starting graduate school at EPFL! Though I had started actually at the end of September, I had ignored writing about it due to an eventful September. Therefore, with my first full month of school done, there was so much to disclose about this whole experience. To foreshadow of whats to come, this schooling experience is like nothing I've ever experienced before. There are pros and cons that I will introduce but all in all, I am happy to have started the thing that I came to this continent for. My life as a European student was just beginning and I can't wait to see whats in store for future months to come. 

School has always been a big deal for me and this was the beginning of attending a strictly engineering and prestigious school. École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) stands as a premier institution renowned for its cutting-edge research and innovative education in Lausanne, Switzerland. With a dedication to excellence in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), EPFL has consistently ranked among the top universities globally. The campus, situated on the picturesque shores of Lac Leman, exudes a blend of academic rigor and natural beauty, fostering an environment that nurtures creativity and intellectual exploration.

EPFL's commitment to pushing the boundaries of knowledge is evident in its state-of-the-art research centers and institutes that span a wide range of disciplines. From nanotechnology to renewable energy, artificial intelligence to bioengineering, the university leads in pioneering breakthroughs that address pressing global challenges. Its collaborative approach encourages interdisciplinary research, enabling students and faculty to engage in projects that transcend traditional academic boundaries.

In the realm of education, EPFL boasts an innovative curriculum that equips students with the skills needed to navigate a rapidly evolving technological landscape. The university's emphasis on practical learning ensures that graduates are well-prepared to contribute to industry and academia alike. Additionally, EPFL's strategic partnerships with industries and organizations allow students to gain real-world insights through internships, projects, and collaborations.

In the heart of Europe, EPFL finds itself in proximity to another renowned institution, Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zürich (ETH Zurich). Both EPFL and ETH Zurich stand as cornerstones of Switzerland's scientific and technological achievements, fostering healthy competition and collaboration between the two institutions. This dynamic partnership has led to groundbreaking research initiatives and a mutual commitment to advancing knowledge and innovation. As EPFL continues to shape the future through its cutting-edge research and forward-thinking education, its influence resonates not only across Switzerland but also on the global stage. Therefore from an institutional perspective, I was more than excited to begin my academic journey at this school filled with many people from all over the world.
