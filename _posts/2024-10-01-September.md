September is always a strange month (at least if you go to a UC school). It’s this awkward period where you ask yourself why school hasn’t started yet, and how summer somehow feels more boring than relaxing. At least for me, that’s always the case. But with school starting this month, it serves as a gentle reminder to take the necessary break before diving into the next academic year. For me, this was especially important.

This summer was probably one of the worst I’ve experienced. Carrying the weight of unfortunate life events and having to study almost every day made it a summer I want to forget. While there were a few nice moments scattered throughout, I still see it as a time I'd rather leave behind. However, to recharge for the upcoming school year, I made sure to take the break I needed. I went back to Iceland, a country that’s vast and desolate, where I could sing in the car, reflect on life, and reconnect with nature.

Before getting into those life events, I thought it was worth sharing that all the studying paid off—I passed my written qualification exam. If there had been one thing that might have kept me from obtaining a Ph.D., it would have been this exam. So, despite everything, I’m happy to say I achieved one big win this summer. Now, onto my Iceland adventures.

# Iceland

I forget when I mentioned that I would stop traveling, but I definitely lied about that. In a way, traveling has become my second nature. It gives me countless stories to tell about the random things I’ve tried, experienced, and learned from being immersed in different cultures. So, after my qualification exam, I took yet another trip—this time back to a country I truly appreciate.

Iceland has become one of my top destinations due to its unforgettable natural beauty. It always strikes me as surreal whenever I visit, because despite being just an island in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, it feels like an entirely different planet. Iceland is famously known as the land of ice and volcanoes, and this trip made that more evident than ever. When I last visited in 2022, I hiked an active volcano, but during this trip, the roads were closed due to recent eruptions—some occurring as recently as a week before I arrived. Lava had blocked access, which was disappointing because I had hoped to witness a volcanic eruption up close. Luckily, this wouldn’t be my last encounter with a volcano on this trip.

### Day 1: Back to Vik

I’ve come to really dislike long flights, and Iceland was no exception. In fact, I’ve started to enjoy traveling to Europe less overall. But a recent solution I found to deal with long flights is sleeping pills—specifically melatonin—which help pass the time. These sleeping pills would prove even more useful later on during the trip as I explored the vast country. From LA, we had a short layover in Toronto before taking an overnight flight to Keflavik. So, as soon as we landed in Iceland, no matter how much sleep I got, it was time to start the day.

Iceland's geography can be confusing. During the flight, you might think you're flying into the capital, Reykjavik, but this is a common misconception. On my previous visit, I had mistakenly booked a car in Reykjavik, only to realize that we were landing in the small town of Keflavik, which is nearly 40 minutes away. This time, I didn’t make the same mistake and picked up a car directly from the airport. Once I had the car, we headed straight to Gullfoss (Golden Falls), which is only accessible in the summer due to harsh weather conditions. 

What made this trip different from my last visit was the extended daylight—16-17 hours compared to just 6 hours of sun before. This changed everything. I could see the stunning landscapes all around me, but it also meant more frequent stops to explore. Every 10 minutes, I found myself pulling over to admire a new, otherworldly terrain, which wasn’t great for gas consumption but made for an unforgettable adventure.
