September is always a strange month (at least if you go to a UC school). It’s this awkward period where you ask yourself why school hasn’t started yet, and how summer somehow feels more boring than relaxing. At least for me, that’s always the case. But with school starting this month, it serves as a gentle reminder to take the necessary break before diving into the next academic year. For me, this was especially important.

This summer was probably one of the worst I’ve experienced. Carrying the weight of unfortunate life events and having to study almost every day made it a summer I want to forget. While there were a few nice moments scattered throughout, I still see it as a time I'd rather leave behind. However, to recharge for the upcoming school year, I made sure to take the break I needed. I went back to Iceland, a country that’s vast and desolate, where I could sing in the car, reflect on life, and reconnect with nature.

Before getting into those life events, I thought it was worth sharing that all the studying paid off—I passed my written qualification exam. If there had been one thing that might have kept me from obtaining a Ph.D., it would have been this exam. So, despite everything, I’m happy to say I achieved one big win this summer. Now, onto my Iceland adventures.

# Iceland

I forget when I mentioned that I would stop traveling, but I totally lied about that. Traveling in a way has become my second personality, where I can talk about a lot of random things I have tried, experienced, and learned from being within different cultures. Well after my qualification exam, I yet again took another trip around the globe back to a country that I really appreciate. 

Iceland has become one of the premiere destinations for me for its unforgettable nature. It always feels so odd to me, whenever I visit because it's just an island in the middle of the atlantic ocean that feels like a totally different planet. Iceland is famously known for being the land of ice and volcanoes and my visit made this extra prevelant. The last time I had visited in 2022, I was able to hike an active volcano, but due to recent erruptions happening as recent as a week before I visited, the roads were entirely closed off due to lava interuppting the road. This was quite sad in a sense because I really wanted to see the volcano explode right in front of my eyes. However, lucky for me this wouldn't be my last encounter with a volcano during this trip.

### Day 1: Back to Vik

I've come to really hate long flights. And Iceland was no exception. In fact in a way I have really begun to enjoy less travling to europe. But a recent solution I have found for dealing with long flights are sleeping pills aka melatonin which help speed up time. These sleeping pills would become much more useful later in the trip as they helped me widely as I exlpored the vast country. From LA, we had a short layover in Toronto before having an overnight flight to Keflavik. So as soon as the day started in Iceland, regardless of how much sleep i got, it was go time. 

Iceland's configuration is a bit confusing because during the flight you are under the impression that you are flying to their capital of Reykyavik, but this is a large myth. Last time I had visited, we had booked a car in the captial but we were surprised to find ourselves in the small town of Keflavik which was nearly 40 minutes apart. However, this time, I did not make this mistake and I was able to pick up a car straight from the airport. So once I picked up my car, it was straight to Gullfoss (Golden Falls) which is only open in the summer due to harsh weather conditions. However, what made this trip different from the last time, was that instead of 6 hours of sun, we had nearly 16-17 hours of daylight. This made the experience incredibly different because I was able to see the beautiful nature all around me. It became a little problematic for gas consumption because I was stopping every 10 minutes to go explore a new terrain that was nothing like I had seen before.
