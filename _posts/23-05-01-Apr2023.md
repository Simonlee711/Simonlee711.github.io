# General Updates

April in Boston brought a refreshing change as the city emerged from the grip of winter. The weather slowly warmed, and the streets became alive with the energy of people eager to enjoy the outdoors. Cherry blossoms adorned the parks, adding bursts of color to the cityscape. It was a month of renewal, both in nature and in spirit, as Bostonians shed their winter coats and embraced the longer days. From strolling along the Charles River every day after work, there was a sense of excitement filled in the air and an astonishment that I had lived in New England for a whole four months. 

On a personal level April was truly a bounce back month. With the days getting longer, I was ready to accept Boston for what it was. Though it was still a little cold for my liking there were still many things in Boston that I have yet to try thus far. Therefore this month was about making memories I wanted to remember. I wanted to put myself out there once again and remember my spring 2023 to be a fun time. To foreshadow for whats to come, it was a truly eventful month in my life. At work I had slowly distanced myself from my co-workers because we had experienced a huge layoff in the month of March which shed into light that you should retain a professional relationship with your co-workers and not get too friendly with them. And by closing the door to making friends at work, it only left one opportunity which was to find my way into some of Boston's infamous college scene. And among all the people I would meet, I found myself finding a small community at the Harvard University going on several side quests during my time there. I partied a lot, met a Harvard girl I liked, and also even dived into the education within Harvard. This month helped change my perspective of my short tenure in Boston as the bounce back to happiness was real. I therefore look forward to sharing some of my stories/highlights from the month of April.


# Top Three Highlights of the Month

### 1. Camilla & Co.

It is safe to say that I have adopted a pretty spontaneous personality. To be honest, I have no idea where this came from and how this spun out because this was unlike anything I had experienced when I was in college. But somehow someway, our story begins at Harvard University where I would meet Camilla de Pourbaix. Sometimes when I think back on the life, I have lived it is these bizarre stories that I will look back on and chuckle because it is truly one of a kind.

But Harvard University is widely regarded as one of the greatest institutions of higher learning in the world. Its reputation for excellence in academics, research, and innovation has been built over centuries, dating back to its founding in 1636. The university's distinguished faculty comprises leading experts and Nobel laureates across various fields, ensuring students receive a world-class education. Harvard's rich history and traditions, combined with its commitment to fostering intellectual curiosity, critical thinking, and diversity, create a vibrant and stimulating environment for both learning and personal growth. Moreover, its extensive resources, state-of-the-art facilities, and numerous research opportunities further enrich the academic experience, making Harvard a beacon of knowledge and an unparalleled place to pursue education and scholarly pursuits. Growing up in the USA, Harvard almost feels like a made up world. The prestige and history that the institution has, was something I never thought I could experience. Since this institution was treated like some myth by many, I also was widely impressed by the students that actually attend this school. But in my head I always had a stigma about Harvard students. Egotistical, Braniacs, but truly special. It isn't every day that you cross paths with a Harvard student so these conceptions stuck for a lot of my life. 

One of the many unique experiences from my time at Boston was being able to go on dates with these mythical beings. Checking off the schools one by one from MIT, Tufts, Northeastern, etc. I had yet to interact with a Harvard student. However one day, I matched with Camilla and we began talking like the people of our generation do. However unlike most conversations, she came immediatley with a request.
