# General Updates

April in Boston brought a refreshing change as the city emerged from the grip of winter. The weather slowly warmed, and the streets became alive with the energy of people eager to enjoy the outdoors. Cherry blossoms adorned the parks, adding bursts of color to the cityscape. It was a month of renewal, both in nature and in spirit, as Bostonians shed their winter coats and embraced the longer days. From strolling along the Charles River every day after work, there was a sense of excitement filled in the air and an astonishment that I had lived in New England for a whole four months. 

On a personal level April was truly a bounce back month. With the days getting longer, I was ready to accept Boston for what it was. Though it was still a little cold for my liking there were still many things in Boston that I have yet to try thus far. Therefore this month was about making memories I wanted to remember. I wanted to put myself out there once again and remember my spring 2023 to be a fun time. To foreshadow for whats to come, it was a truly eventful month in my life. At work I had slowly distanced myself from my co-workers because we had experienced a huge layoff in the month of March which shed into light that you should retain a professional relationship with your co-workers and not get too friendly with them. And by closing the door to making friends at work, it only left one opportunity which was to find my way into some of Boston's infamous college scene. And among all the people I would meet, I found myself finding a small community at the Harvard University going on several side quests during my time there. I partied a lot, met a Harvard girl I liked, and also even dived into the education within Harvard. This month helped change my perspective of my short tenure in Boston as the bounce back to happiness was real. I therefore look forward to sharing some of my stories/highlights from the month of April.


# Top Three Highlights of the Month

### 1. Camilla & Co.

This month I will be writing my three highlights in sequential order because they are all interconnected. Therefore this month, our three highlights take place in the infamous Harvard square located in Cambridge, Massachusettes where I would meet Camilla de Pourbaix. But since my life is anything but normal, I think it is worth mentioning how we met to begin with. In the previous months, I expressed the difficult of making friends as a young adult. And just because the weather got warmer, the issue did not get any better. Therefore in the February blog which you can read [here](https://simonlee711.github.io/blogging/Feb2023/), I talked about how I had been using dating apps to make friends. Camilla fell into this category as well, and we met on the Hinge dating app. However from the start, her intentions were not to go out on a date and she was very adamant about a request she had. She told me she needed help with a project at Harvard and this enticed me for two reaons. Number one was because I wanted to get a taste of the Harvard education system, and two was because Why in the world would she ask someone like me. So we soon scheduled a lunch meeting and went into more details.

At this lunch, I got to know both Camilla the student, her background, and the problem at hand. She was a foreign student from the UK with a European/Japanese background who was in the midst of her second year as an English/Government student. At the time she told me she was interested in getting her Ph.D., her M.D., and J.D. before deciding what she wanted to do. I can't verify the truth to this statement but nevertheless I was in the presence of Harvard Greatness. She told me about life in the UK, her desires to live on a farm one day, and the reason she began to study English in the first place (She had a traumatic childhood experience with a mean English teacher...). This was my first ever interaction with a Harvard student, and it was simply an enriching conversation to say the least. They had true ambitions, the desired work ethic, and some crazy background story that got them in this prestigious University. But why did she need me was still the looming question at hand?

In the Spring Semester, Camilla was in the middle of taking a data driven course, where she was asked to design and conduct her own data driven study about something in Politics. However rightfully so, she told me she had no experience designing an experiment, and had despised maths for most of her life. And since data scientist was in my bio on Hinge, she made the request to ask me to help her. When I asked why she didn't just ask another student, she talked about the toxic climate at Harvard about people never asking for help. For so long, these people have done everything by themselves and asking for help was seen to be a form of weakness. I appreicated her honesty, and disagreed with this viewpoint, and I therefore was recruited to join in on her project. In brief it was a study of whether Gerrymandering had a correlation to Polarization within the House of Representatives. Though I have no domain knowledge in Politics whatsoever, we began our collaboration bringing data science and poltics into unison. It was the start to something really fun.

Helping people has always held a special place in my heart. There's an indescribable sense of fulfillment that washes over me when I know I've made a positive impact on someone's life, no matter how small. It's like a chain reaction of positivity â€“ the smile that lights up their face, the gratitude in their eyes, and the knowledge that I've made their day a little better. But it's not just about the external validation; it's an intrinsic feeling that warms my soul. Knowing that I've played a part, however minor, in easing someone's burden or brightening their day brings a profound sense of purpose. It's a reminder that we're all interconnected, and a simple act of kindness can create ripples of positivity that extend far beyond the moment. Helping others isn't just about what I can do for them; it's about the joy and fulfillment it brings to my own life, enriching my own journey in ways I could never have imagined. 

Therefore in Camilla's case this was no different. It was such a unqiue and fun experience for me and with my paired ambitious personality it made to be a fun story to tell. Luckily part of my job involves thinking about the problems I am working on so it wasn't always coding and analyzing 24/7. Therefore I would take some days off of work (Sorry Celsius) to commute to Harvard to go think about both her research problem as well as some of mine at work. I would do this once or twice per week throughout the months of April (& May) until we made a paper we were proud of. For me, this was a true assessment of what I knew about my field because before we even started on an experiment, we needed to have a mutual understanding of what was to go on. So I felt like I also got a lot of practice mentoring and teaching her statistical analysis that could be understood by a liberal arts major. It never helped that she had an insane schedule filled with clubs, swim & dive team, plus an insane academic schedule but it also was a testament to our willingness to sacrafice to make this whole thing work. 

I remember vividly about one night where I went out to a bar with my friend Lauren Takenaga from the January Blog to go get drinks at a bar, then suddenly being asked to help her for the next 4 hours to help write a rough draft of the paper. Her writing was truly a piece of art, and was well beyond my skills. But again we would collaborate to find a mutual understanding of what we were both doing. There were many points of frustration for the both of us, because our fields had hardly any overlap (and because I was a little drunk), but we managed to write a pretty amazing rough draft. I would wake up super early (e.g. 4 am) to read her submissions that she would send periodically, because the deadlines were at like 7am. Though it was a bit painful to manage both her work and my work, we managed to get it done. The final paper was pretty darn amazing, and we ended up doing a correlation study between two measureable metrics involving Polarization & Gerrymandering. The data processing turned out to be the biggest pain in the ass, and so much so that I ended up hiring a free lance Fiver data entry guy, to make the data spreadsheets for me. However regardless of the hardships, it was a truly fun experience. You can read the full paper [here](https://github.com/Simonlee711/gerrymandering-polarisation-study/blob/main/Prospectus%20Final.pdf).

However from this all, we grew as friends and she introduced me to a brand new community I never thought I'd find myself in. I found myself in Harvards elite inner circle now, after she invited me to a house party she was throwing with her friends at the Quad. There I made sure to network and make even more friends which will be discussed in some proceeding sections. In addition, she had mentioned the idea of going to Japan, and for some reason I was very on board and felt a sense of need to take time off work to go on this Spontaneous trip (Sorry Celsius Again). Regardless I have no regrets about making this decision. Camilla became one of my good friends, I got to experience the Harvard education system, and she ended up acing the paper. I couldn't ask for much else and I was happy to have been apart of her story and it has become one of my favorite ones to tell.
