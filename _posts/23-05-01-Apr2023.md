# General Updates

April in Boston brought a refreshing change as the city emerged from the grip of winter. The weather slowly warmed, and the streets became alive with the energy of people eager to enjoy the outdoors. Cherry blossoms adorned the parks, adding bursts of color to the cityscape. It was a month of renewal, both in nature and in spirit, as Bostonians shed their winter coats and embraced the longer days. From strolling along the Charles River every day after work, there was a sense of excitement filled in the air and an astonishment that I had lived in New England for a whole four months. 

On a personal level April was truly a bounce back month. With the days getting longer, I was ready to accept Boston for what it was. Though it was still a little cold for my liking there were still many things in Boston that I have yet to try thus far. Therefore this month was about making memories I wanted to remember. I wanted to put myself out there once again and remember my spring 2023 to be a fun time. To foreshadow for whats to come, it was a truly eventful month in my life. At work I had slowly distanced myself from my co-workers because we had experienced a huge layoff in the month of March which shed into light that you should retain a professional relationship with your co-workers and not get too friendly with them. And by closing the door to making friends at work, it only left one opportunity which was to find my way into some of Boston's infamous college scene. And among all the people I would meet, I found myself finding a small community at the Harvard University going on several side quests during my time there. I partied a lot, met a Harvard girl I liked, and also even dived into the education within Harvard. This month helped change my perspective of my short tenure in Boston as the bounce back to happiness was real. I therefore look forward to sharing some of my stories/highlights from the month of April.


# Top Three Highlights of the Month

### 1. Camilla & Co.

This month I will be writing my three highlights in sequential order because they are all interconnected. Therefore this month, our three highlights take place in the infamous Harvard square located in Cambridge, Massachusettes where I would meet Camilla de Pourbaix. But since my life is anything but normal, I think it is worth mentioning how we met to begin with. In the previous months, I expressed the difficult of making friends as a young adult. And just because the weather got warmer, the issue did not get any better. Therefore in the February blog which you can read [here](https://simonlee711.github.io/blogging/Feb2023/), I talked about how I had been using dating apps to make friends. Camilla fell into this category as well, and we met on the Hinge dating app. However from the start, her intentions were not to go out on a date and she was very adamant about a request she had. She told me she needed help with a project at Harvard and this enticed me for two reaons. Number one was because I wanted to get a taste of the Harvard education system, and two was because Why in the world would she ask someone like me. So we soon scheduled a lunch meeting and went into more details.

At this lunch, I got to know both Camilla the student, her background, and the problem at hand. She was a foreign student from the UK with a European/Japanese background who was in the midst of her second year as an English/Government student. At the time she told me she was interested in getting her Ph.D., her M.D., and J.D. before deciding what she wanted to do. I can't verify the truth to this statement but nevertheless I was in the presence of Harvard Greatness. She told me about life in the UK, her desires to live on a farm one day, and the reason she began to study English in the first place (She had a traumatic childhood experience with a mean English teacher...). This was my first ever interaction with a Harvard student, and it was simply an enriching conversation to say the least. They had true ambitions, the desired work ethic, and some crazy background story that got them in this prestigious University. But why did she need me was still the looming question at hand?

In the Spring Semester, Camilla was in the middle of taking a data driven course, where she was asked to design and conduct her own data driven study about something in Politics. However rightfully so, she told me she had no experience designing an experiment, and had despised maths for most of her life. And since data scientist was in my bio on Hinge, she made the request to ask me to help her. When I asked why she didn't just ask another student, she talked about the toxic climate at Harvard about people never asking for help. For so long, these people have done everything by themselves and asking for help was seen to be a form of weakness. I appreicated her honesty, and disagreed with this viewpoint, and I therefore was recruited to join in on her project. In brief it was a study of whether Gerrymandering had a correlation to Polarization within the House of Representatives. Though I have no domain knowledge in Politics whatsoever, we began our collaboration bringing data science and poltics into unison. It was the start to something really fun.

Helping people has always held a special place in my heart. There's an indescribable sense of fulfillment that washes over me when I know I've made a positive impact on someone's life, no matter how small. It's like a chain reaction of positivity â€“ the smile that lights up their face, the gratitude in their eyes, and the knowledge that I've made their day a little better. But it's not just about the external validation; it's an intrinsic feeling that warms my soul. Knowing that I've played a part, however minor, in easing someone's burden or brightening their day brings a profound sense of purpose. It's a reminder that we're all interconnected, and a simple act of kindness can create ripples of positivity that extend far beyond the moment. Helping others isn't just about what I can do for them; it's about the joy and fulfillment it brings to my own life, enriching my own journey in ways I could never have imagined. 

Therefore in Camilla's case this was no different. It was such a unqiue and fun experience for me and with my paired ambitious personality it made to be a fun story to tell. Luckily part of my job involves thinking about the problems I am working on so it wasn't always coding and analyzing 24/7. Therefore I would take some days off of work (Sorry Celsius) to commute to Harvard to go think about both her research problem as well as some of mine at work. I would do this once or twice per week throughout the months of April (& May) until we made a paper we were proud of. For me, this was a true assessment of what I knew about my field because before we even started on an experiment, we needed to have a mutual understanding of what was to go on. So I felt like I also got a lot of practice mentoring and teaching her statistical analysis that could be understood by a liberal arts major. It never helped that she had an insane schedule filled with clubs, swim & dive team, plus an insane academic schedule but it also was a testament to our willingness to sacrafice to make this whole thing work. 

I remember vividly about one night where I went out to a bar with my friend Lauren Takenaga from the January Blog to go get drinks at a bar, then suddenly being asked to help her for the next 4 hours to help write a rough draft of the paper. Her writing was truly a piece of art, and was well beyond my skills. But again we would collaborate to find a mutual understanding of what we were both doing. There were many points of frustration for the both of us, because our fields had hardly any overlap (and because I was a little drunk), but we managed to write a pretty amazing rough draft. I would wake up super early (e.g. 4 am) to read her submissions that she would send periodically, because the deadlines were at like 7am. Though it was a bit painful to manage both her work and my work, we managed to get it done. The final paper was pretty darn amazing, and we ended up doing a correlation study between two measureable metrics involving Polarization & Gerrymandering. The data processing turned out to be the biggest pain in the ass, and so much so that I ended up hiring a free lance Fiver data entry guy, to make the data spreadsheets for me. However regardless of the hardships, it was a truly fun experience. You can read the full paper [here](https://github.com/Simonlee711/gerrymandering-polarisation-study/blob/main/Prospectus%20Final.pdf).

However from this all, we grew as friends and she introduced me to a brand new community I never thought I'd find myself in. I found myself in Harvards elite inner circle now, after she invited me to a house party she was throwing with her friends at the Quad. There I made sure to network and make even more friends which will be discussed in some proceeding sections. In addition, she had mentioned the idea of going to Japan, and for some reason I was very on board and felt a sense of need to take time off work to go on this Spontaneous trip (Sorry Celsius Again). Regardless I have no regrets about making this decision. Camilla became one of my good friends, I got to experience the Harvard education system, and she ended up acing the paper. I couldn't ask for much else and I was happy to have been apart of her story and it has become one of my favorite ones to tell.

### 2. Harvard University Formals

After finding myself a nice group of friends at Harvard, I apparently had plenty of opportunities to experience some of the schools culture. And to be real honest, Harvard had a surprisngly fun school culture. For how academically challenging this institution can be, these people know how to equally have just as much fun. And one of the most exciting weeks at Harvard actually happens when classes wrap up after 15 or so long weeks. All the weeks of cramming lead up to this point, which was their notorious Reading period. Personally I had never experienced a reading period, but essentially it is the week before finals where you are given time off to study and prepare as you will. But at Harvard, all the social House formals take place during this week. A House is sort of a term loosely related to those found in Harry Potter when the protagonists find themselves in Godric Gryffindor, Salazar Slytherin, Rowena Ravenclaw, or Helga Hufflepuff. Similarly there were like 8-9 Harvard houses which all independently run events sponsored by the school or by former alumni that lived in these houses. Private schools showed a significant culture shock to me in the sense that they had a lot of money and were not afraid to show it. A lot of these formals included free alcohol, really nice venues, and a truly unforgettable night. I will lightly recap the three main ones I attended and what the overall week was like to me.

I also wanted to give a special shoutout to Giselle and Van, who invited me to all these events along with some unmentioned ones during my time at Harvard. I told them that I wanted a bigger social experience in Boston, and they were happy to give that to me. So to them I am truly grateful <3.

**Night 1 - Melanie Volz & Ivy Formal:** The first night of the formal season was definitely the lowest on budget, but I think the people that were at this event were close to my favorite if not my favorite. The group dynamic there was truly a really fun time and I had a blast being apart of it. Truth is Ivy was not a House at all but a social club run on campus. Therefore unlike some of the other formals I attended throughout the week, this one was on the more lax side. However at this formal, I went with a truly special girl named Melanie Volz. I want to preface by saying that I usually am not in awe of people but she was one of the exceptions. 

In the short time I have known her, this girl embraces Harvard like no one else. She was also in the midst of her second year at Harvard where she was studying applied mathematics (Just like me!!!) and art history. In High School she ranked #1 in the state of New York in mathematics, was very passionate about art history, and volunteered her time either helping teach mathematics or at a museum. She scored the highest GPA at her high school making her the valedictorian, and best of all when you [Google her](https://www.google.com/search?q=melanie+volz&oq=melanie+volz&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIKCAEQLhixAxiABDIHCAIQABiABDIHCAMQABiABDIHCAQQLhiABDIHCAUQLhiABDIKCAYQLhjUAhiABDIKCAcQLhjUAhiABDIKCAgQLhjUAhiABNIBCDI1NTVqMGo3qAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8), there are many articles that come up about her amazing academic track. However, more than her brains, I was more in awe of the person she was. She was beautiful but had an amazing personality to match her outstanding background. There wasn't more you could ask for in a human being.
