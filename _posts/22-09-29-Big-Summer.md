This summer I was fortunate enough to spend it at UCLA apart of the Bruins in Genomics summer program. If you are more interested in the research side of things, I highly recommend you check that out under the projects tab where I wrote about my summer research. This post is moreso about life at UCLA and all the great people I was able to meet. 

I first heard about this program from Professor Vanessa Jonsson, my research advisor at UCSC and she told me it would be a great opportunity to get my foot in the door if I wanted to enter biomathematics. At the time I was unsure what exactly I wanted to do but there was some degree of interest after working in research with Professor Jonsson. That summer I knew was going to be my first summer after college but I gave this opportunity a chance because I needed practical experience for any sort of job. I applied and a few weeks later I actually got in! I was actually extremely happy since I actually wanted to do my undergraduate degree at UCLA but was never ready when I had completed high school. So roughly in March when I was accepted, I knew that I was going to be spending my summer in Lala Los Angeles. 

Los Angeles was exciting for a few reasons. First off, the city is iconic and is pictured in the movies as this super sunny nice beachy city that produces the best movie stars. In fact my favorite movie is La la Land and that movies plot and presentation had me really excited to spend my summer there. Additionally as a sports fan, I was a huge Los Angeles Lakers fan so that was just another reason to be looking forward to the opportunity. Though they weren't in season in the summer, just being in the city with the worlds biggest stars excited me. 

Fast forward to June, and truth be told I was a little sad at the time. I had just graduated college, which is supposed to be the happiest years of your life and it was very unclear where or when I would see some of the people I met at UCSC for the next time. Closing a chapter of your life is never easy because of all the precious times and memories you were able to make in that moment. SO up until my flight to LAX, I was pretty down. However as soon as I landed, the energy was just different. The weather was super sunny but not burning hot and the atmosphere was just on a higher amplitude. Los Angeles was filled with culture and I couldn't wait to get started. I was picked up by one of my long time friends at LAX and he was kind enough to get me my first meal and drop me off at De Neve Plaza where I would be staying this summer. 

Once I got to UCLA, I was able to meet my roommate Saiyang Li. At the time it was a little awkward like it always is with new roommates but now I consider him one of my greatest friends. We walked around UCLA's enormous and gorgeous campus together and I was at such a loss of words of how awesome this summer was going to be. That night I met even more great people at the SPUR pizza dinner and I knew at this point summer was going to be great! I was super ecstatic to meet people all over America who shared similar interests to what I liked and that was something so valuable. Usually friendships stem from similarities and it was really easy to speak and get along with these people. But the network was just as crazy to me. These 8 next weeks we would be spending a lot of time together but once the program finished, the thought of having friends from Puerto Rico, New Jersey, North Carolina, etc. was just kind of crazy. This concept of meeting people around the world was not very new but it was new for me to meet people around the world with similar interests. Also there was a diverse spread of people which made it even better. 

As time progressed we got integrated into our labs and actually began work but since I was so happy to just be here, it made it feel like I was not working at all. There was never a day where I dreaded going to "work" because it was just such a healthy work environment. I really liked the feel of having my own desk at Engineering VI because it made me feel as if I was some sort of software engineer working for UCLA, a globally recognized institution. We had key cards, different server logins, and I felt really official during my time here. On top of that our office space was shared between multiple labs so there was a good chunk of us working in the same space. This made getting lunch together, and just spending time together on our breaks all so much better. 

However one of my favorite parts about this summer was the events that occurred after work. For most of my life I did not consider myself a totally social person but I sort of absolutely changed that during my time here. I made it an effort to meet all the bright-minded people and wanted to hear their background and stories. This was hands down the best thing I did this summer because I get to hear so many perspectives and lifestyles that all work for ourselves. I am proud to say I am no where near my final "form" so it was nice to always hear about new things from new people. So all this talking and socializing occurred during events planned by us. I would say I made a substantial effort to plan events because I simply just loved the comraderie. I left my dorm room always open to anyone and almost every night we would get a group of old and new people to talk about the most random things together. The laughs and the memories we shared even in such simple moments were so invaluable to me. 

One of my most favorite events from the summer, however was my 21st birthday. 21 is typically a huge year for many years and I was super excited to spend it in Los Angeles. My birthday was on a Monday but that did not stop me from making sure to celebrate properly. After work ended around 5pm, I got dinner with a few friends at Ami Sushi to start the festivities. After that I ran a small little social event at De Neve where I shared a toast with all the amazing people I have been able to meet up until this time. We all shared a glass of champagne and I was super grateful to just have a group of brand new friends that accepted me quickly. 

Some other events we had on occasion were going to various places across Los Angeles: Venice Beach, Malibu, Downtwon LA, etc. Exploring Los angeles was also just very exciting. My ambition that I think is rather newly developed began through just exploring Los Angeles and what it had to offer. One of my favorite memories of this was going to a LGBTQ+ book store where we were given 3 free books written by LGBTQ+ authors. I was never really exposed to literature work from these types of authors so it just added to the experience of reading their persepctives. It was very rewarding to have gone but to also hear the experiences of those who are within the LGBTQ+ community in this program. In fact I would say a good majority were LGBTQ+ which really exposed me to a lot just about their community. 

The last thing I wanted to also write about was the valuable time I got to spend with Noelle Wheeler. I think it was safe to say that she was my absolute best friend during this program. She did her bachelors at UCLA so she knew a lot about the area as well as had a car which was huge. We shared the same lab space at Engineering VI and to be honest there was not a moment from the day I met her that we were really apart. She was incredibly smart and just a fun prescence to be around. There was not a dull day with her and she was truly a big part of my summer. We explored a lot of Los Angeles together, ate lunch together nearly everyday, and were just able to develop a life long friendship within this short 8 week research program. I was super lucky to meet such an incredible person and share a lot of my summer with her. 

Well this turned out to be a lot of writing. It is safe to say I left off a lot of great things still but there really is not that much space to write more unless I want to make this blog post into a full fledged journal. I just wanted to say thank you to whoever allowed me to enter this program because it truly changed my life. I met the coolest people, worked on some pretty impactful research, and was **the happiest** I have ever been in my life. These 8 weeks went by too fast and I am just at such a loss of words that it ended so soon. However, I told most of them that this is not the end, and that I would travel across the world just to go see a lot of them once again. I also just wanted to give a special shoutouts to well who I alluded to in this story without actually name dropping them:

- Osagie
- Victoria
- Anna
- Philippa
- Aahna

Thanks for making my summer is unbelievably amazing and thanks for reading!
