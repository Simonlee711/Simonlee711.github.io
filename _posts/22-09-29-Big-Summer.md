This summer I was fortunate enough to spend it at UCLA apart of the bruins in genomics summer program. While I discussed my research under the projects section, I wanted to discuss how the summer went in general. While its been around a month and a half since the program has ended, I still cannot truly comprehend how amazing this summer was. I've organized my thoughts into three primary reasons: friends, location, healthy work-to-life balance.

The best aspect of this summer was the huge network of people I was able to make and the hardest thing to leave behind. I personally made it an effort to meet almost every single person who opted into in person, simply by eating breakfast with them, sitting with them at lunch, or joining them on weekend activities. This allowed me to meet around 40 other amazing students coming from all over America. What makes it even more exciting was that we all shared some common interest in Computational biology so I am hoping we all somehow will meet again in our future careers. I will forever cherish this particular aspect of this summer because the people themselves are the reason I felt the happiest I have ever been. Although most days I would not get enough sleep, I would wake up full of energy and ready to work hard another day. 

This leads me to my next reason which was the location. Los Angeles is sort of amazing as a youngster because there are many micro cities within one large city. This ties back to the people aspect, but I very much enjoyed exploring a lot of Los Angeles this summer with these people. I would say we covered most of the coast from Malibu all the way down to Venice Beach while also exploring much of Hollywood and much much more. The weather was absolutely not a joke, and it really is the perfect climate to be in. Although some days were rather hot, we were fortunate enough to have air conditioning within our rooms which never made it an issue. I was therefore grateful to have been in such a spectacular place where I could thrive.

Lastly, this summer was a perfect work-to-life balance which is so important especially as someone who is trying to pursue a Ph.D. The culture of being within a (dry) lab was very nice. I felt very productive in the space that they provided me, and I also felt like when I needed a break, I was able to take them. It was comforting to not only experience this atmosphere but also something I really want to have in my future career. Although we worked "full time" this summer, it never felt as if work was the only things on our mind. For this reason I've almost have become addicted to this feeling and I now wish to chase it again.

Overall this summer will forever be a happy memory in my life. It was spent with amazing people in an awesome location where I truly got to maximize both my time in the lab and doing outside activities. I am so grateful to have been selected and to have been able to create all the memories I could. So thank you UCLA!
