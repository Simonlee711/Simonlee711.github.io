Europe has been full of experiences where I feel like I have had to grow up by 10+ years. However what's sort of crazy is that I have only been here for two months. If I am being brutally honest, it has not been the smoothest transition moving to this new country. But I believe that is just one of the things you risk when you are ambitious. During the summer I sort did not plan a whole lot since I was not physically in the country but a lack of preparedness has raised the discomfort bar by a ten fold. However, today I wanted to talk about Discipline and what it has meant and been for me since I have arrived in Europe.

I define discipline as having a sense of self control and holding yourself accountable. I have to be very disciplined and sharp nearly everyday just so I can live the life I thought of upon my arrival to Switzerland. For those who are not aware, I have been living in Evian-les-bains, France, a whole different country from where I attend school. I commute by ferry AND metro everyday and discipline to me starts every monring at around 5:50am when I have to wake up for my commute to school. Every morning I wake up at 5:50am so I can shower, prepare a full days of food, as well as pack all my belongings I will need for my classes throughout the day. Also note that my first class does not begin until 8:00am or 9:00am every morning. After doing my morning preparation, I walk to the dock where I board the ferry and typically it is pitch black with the sun not rising for another 30 minutes or so. I purposefully get to the dock early because that means I can board the ferry sooner. Once the ferry leaves the dock at 7:00am, I usually read a textbook or book for the 35 minute journey. Every morning starts like this and to be punctual, the real marathon begins after leaving the ferry. 

To help picture the scene, it is around 7:35am at this point and I am preparing to take the metro that goes directly to EPFL. However the commute to EPFL varies on average of about 21 minutes with a standard deviation of +/- 4 [17min, 25min]. This is due to no space on the metro, catching consecutive lines, and other super variable factors. However since I have class at 8:00am, I always want to be on the earlier side so I can arrive without being late for class. So as soon as I get off the ferry, I power walk to the metro station which takes roughly 4 minutes to catch the literal next possible metro. After around 5 stations from Ouchy to Lausanne Flon, I have to switch metro lines to catch another metro that leads me directly to school. There is always a part of me that wants to just wait for when there is space, but I am not built like that. After getting to EPFL, I have around 3-5 minutes now to walk to my classrooms. 

Once I arrive at school, I prepare to spend a whole day there. Because my commutes back home takes around 3 hours there and back, it does not make sense for me to go home every time I have breaks. However this is not usually an issue because I have around 8 hours of lecture and section per day. This however only explains part of the discipline that I have to hold myself to everyday.

I slightly alluded to having to pack food for a whole day and though it seems rather unimportant, it is an essential part of my life as a student. Because I start my days at 5:50am and do not get home until around 7-8:00pm, I have to pack my own food. Though there are many campus restauarants and grocery stores nearby, I guess it is important to note that I am supporting myself financially. As someone who has worked during my time as an undergraduate student, you can probably infer that I do not have a lot of savings overall. Therefore in a financial point of view, I physically am unable to sustain eating out while paying for all the other essentials in my life (rent, groceries, commute passes, etc.). So while all my friends and classmates are able to eat out everyday, I usually bring lunch from home. Nutriously, the lunch I bring is not great (usually the same sandwich + chips everyday) but it is enough to keep me through the day. I sometimes think that I can just buy food but to me that is equivalent to accepting defeat. I therefore tell myself I have to remain disciplined throughout the day and most likely through the year. 

After my evening classes conclude around 6:00pm, the clock is ticking once again. The ferry schedule is not totally great with ferries coming within every 1hr 20min +/- 15 min. This means I have to leave school immediatley so I can catch the next ferry at 6:40pm. Usually boarding the boat begins at 6:25pm so the earlier the better. Once I get off the boat at around 7:15pm, I walk back and arrive back to my airbnb at around 7:30pm. Once I get home, I shower then prepare myself dinner. Dinner usually entails pasta, noodles, rice and their has not been much diversity in foods besides that. I quickly eat so I can begin homework, read material where I usually cut myself off at 11pm so I can get roughly six and a half hours of sleep. I set myself this limit because I used to stay up much later but would be extremely drowsy at school. 

This cycle repeats nearly everyday and it has been a relatively rough schedule. However it is thanks to my discipline that I am able to repeat these sequences of events everyday. I always thought of myself as hardworking and disciplined but moving here has shown me a new level to this feat. All in all I am doing well though. I am learning a lot which is great and I have really come to enjoy my daily treks acorss the 35 minute Lac Leman ferry ride. I guess I knew things would not be easy but hey as long as I stay disciplined which I know I can be, I can make this life work. So thanks for reading!
