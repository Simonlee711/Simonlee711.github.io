February was filled with both high and low moments, which is a natural representation of the human experience. Prior to arriving in Boston, I had been warned by family and friends about the brutal winters in the city, and they were not exaggerating. On February 4th, 2023, the entire East Coast experienced severe weather conditions, with a record low temperature of -10 degrees Fahrenheit (-23 degrees Celsius for my international friends). I vividly remember that day, as I had to walk to work wearing nearly six layers of clothing, yet still feeling the biting wind chills in my bones. It was only then that I realized anything below 0 degrees Fahrenheit is considered dangerously cold, and I had foolishly exposed myself to such weather. However, some areas near Boston had it even worse than I could ever imagine. Mount Washington in New Hampshire recorded a bone-chilling low of -108 degrees Fahrenheit, including the wind chill. Considering my struggles with -23 degrees Celsius, I couldn't fathom just how freakishly cold that must have been. Needless to say, this experience served as a stark reminder of the truly harsh and brutal winters in New England.

In addition to the brutal winters, the transition to adulthood has presented me with a few challenges. At just 21 years old, I began experiencing a peculiar disconnect between my professional self and my true self. From a professional standpoint, it feels like I've fast-forwarded through life and am being treated as if I'm much older than I actually am. This becomes particularly evident in the workplace, where I consistently interact with individuals who have over 10 years of experience on me. While being surrounded by older colleagues can have its advantages, it also creates a noticeable gap between myself and those around me. Our priorities at our respective stages of life are significantly different. When my peers ask me about my weekend, it feels somewhat foreign to share the truth, as I may have been busy enjoying nightlife while they were focused on taking care of their young children. Another aspect I quickly picked up on was the need to justify my decisions during group meetings. Instead of simply providing progress updates, these meetings sometimes felt more like defending a Ph.D. thesis. These factors combined to create an interesting dynamic in the workplace, but this is just one side of the story.

On the other hand, I was just a 21-year-old navigating adulthood on my own. While I had become accustomed to the logistical aspects of adulthood such as managing my own chores, paying rent, and making responsible decisions, there was still so much more for which I was unprepared. One of the biggest changes I experienced since transitioning from academia to the industry was the 9-5 schedule. The traditional 9-5 meant having a regular 8-hour workday, but it also meant having an abundance of free time outside those hours. And the concept of free time was foreign to me. For so long, I had been consumed by completing homework, attending club meetings, networking, and engaging in social activities. But suddenly, none of that seemed to exist anymore. So, to sit and do nothing sometimes felt almost wrong. I had always maintained a schedule filled with activities and obligations, and now, for the first time, I had free time but no idea how to utilize it. At 21, I imagined myself still in the midst of college, making foolish decisions, and enjoying the carefree years of my early twenties. But my life felt so different from that. It felt real and legitimate, and I wasn't sure if I fully resonated with how everything was unfolding.

As a result, this month, I experienced a series of spirals that took a toll on my mental health. The cold and gloomy days in February left me feeling lost, unsure of which direction to turn when I needed guidance. Perhaps seeking help from my older co-workers would be seen as a sign of immaturity and weakness. On the other hand, explaining my situation to my friends at university wouldn't be very beneficial since they had no understanding of this side of adulthood. There were moments when I felt stuck and possibly regretful about leaving college early, but there were also plenty of benefits that came with this month. Overall, the message I'm trying to convey is that the transition to adulthood is never as easy as it may seem. Moving from being a carefree college student to a full-fledged professional isn't a straightforward journey, and the multifaceted nature of adulthood only adds to its complexities. There are certainly things I wish I had known before growing up so quickly, but I also believe that's what makes life exciting. Unraveling and navigating life as it unfolds presents its own set of challenges, but for me, it continues to shape my open-minded and reflective mindset, adding character to my personal growth.
