February was filled with both high and low moments, which is a natural representation of the human experience. Prior to arriving in Boston, I had been warned by family and friends about the brutal winters in the city, and they were not exaggerating. On February 4th, 2023, the entire East Coast experienced severe weather conditions, with a record low temperature of -10 degrees Fahrenheit (-23 degrees Celsius for my international friends). I vividly remember that day, as I had to walk to work wearing nearly six layers of clothing, yet still feeling the biting wind chills in my bones. It was only then that I realized anything below 0 degrees Fahrenheit is considered dangerously cold, and I had foolishly exposed myself to such weather. However, some areas near Boston had it even worse than I could ever imagine. Mount Washington in New Hampshire recorded a bone-chilling low of -108 degrees Fahrenheit, including the wind chill. Considering my struggles with -23 degrees Celsius, I couldn't fathom just how freakishly cold that must have been. Needless to say, this experience served as a stark reminder of the truly harsh and brutal winters in New England.

In addition to the brutal winters, the transition to adulthood has presented me with a few challenges. At just 21 years old, I began experiencing a peculiar disconnect between my professional self and my true self. From a professional standpoint, it feels like I've fast-forwarded through life and am being treated as if I'm much older than I actually am. This becomes particularly evident in the workplace, where I consistently interact with individuals who have over 10 years of experience on me. While being surrounded by older colleagues can have its advantages, it also creates a noticeable gap between myself and those around me. Our priorities at our respective stages of life are significantly different. When my peers ask me about my weekend, it feels somewhat foreign to share the truth, as I may have been busy enjoying nightlife while they were focused on taking care of their young children. Another aspect I quickly picked up on was the need to justify my decisions during group meetings. Instead of simply providing progress updates, these meetings sometimes felt more like defending a Ph.D. thesis. These factors combined to create an interesting dynamic in the workplace, but this is just one side of the story.

On the other hand, I was just a 21-year-old navigating adulthood on my own. While I had become accustomed to the logistical aspects of adulthood such as managing my own chores, paying rent, and making responsible decisions, there was still so much more for which I was unprepared. One of the biggest changes I experienced since transitioning from academia to the industry was the 9-5 schedule. The traditional 9-5 meant having a regular 8-hour workday, but it also meant having an abundance of free time outside those hours. And the concept of free time was foreign to me. For so long, I had been consumed by completing homework, attending club meetings, networking, and engaging in social activities. But suddenly, none of that seemed to exist anymore. So, to sit and do nothing sometimes felt almost wrong. I had always maintained a schedule filled with activities and obligations, and now, for the first time, I had free time but no idea how to utilize it. At 21, I imagined myself still in the midst of college, making foolish decisions, and enjoying the carefree years of my early twenties. But my life felt so different from that. It felt real and legitimate, and I wasn't sure if I fully resonated with how everything was unfolding.

As a result, this month, I experienced a series of spirals that took a toll on my mental health. The cold and gloomy days in February left me feeling lost, unsure of which direction to turn when I needed guidance. Perhaps seeking help from my older co-workers would be seen as a sign of immaturity and weakness. On the other hand, explaining my situation to my friends at university wouldn't be very beneficial since they had no understanding of this side of adulthood. There were moments when I felt stuck and possibly regretful about leaving college early, but there were also plenty of benefits that came with this month. Overall, the message I'm trying to convey is that the transition to adulthood is never as easy as it may seem. Moving from being a carefree college student to a full-fledged professional isn't a straightforward journey, and the multifaceted nature of adulthood only adds to its complexities. There are certainly things I wish I had known before growing up so quickly, but I also believe that's what makes life exciting. Unraveling and navigating life as it unfolds presents its own set of challenges, but for me, it continues to shape my open-minded and reflective mindset, adding character to my personal growth.

# Top Three Highlights of the Month

### 1. Getting an offer into a Ph.D. Program

The first highlight of the month was part of a long initiative that started way back in November when I contacted my former principal investigator (PI), Jeffrey Chiang, about the thought of a Ph.D. After exchanging a few set of emails with him, he gave me the confidence to retry my luck and give it a shot. Graduate admissions in general are a brutal process, and I'm not totally sure what the required criterion is to get into these programs. However, with Jeff being apart of the department I was applying to, it felt like a possible "in" to the program. Few months later, I got an email in late February informing me that I had been admitted into the Computational Medicine Ph.D. program at UCLA, which ended up being the only program I actually applied to. The silly but true reason was because it was the only free application I was granted among the other schools. I had preliminary thoughts about applying to UCSF but ultimatley didn't press submit when the deadline came. Regardless I was estactic to be accepted, and I therefore wanted to share my experience on how it happened from my POV.

One of my goals or New Years resolutions to start the new year was to become a better writer. However, this goal to become a better writer started way before the new year. It was the reasoning to start this first iteration of the blog (which has mostly been archived...). Something about storytelling deemed to be a very practical skill in the real world, and I was finding ways to become a better story teller. I read books, watched movies, played video games, just to follow the linearity and nonlinearity's of storytelling. The reasoning behind trying to improve this skill in particular was because I was told by a former PI, that my writing was not clear. It was all constructive criticism at the end of the day, but this one stung. However, I have always been the type of person, when told I can't do something, to go out and do it. In a way, I took this moment personally, and wanted to prove my former PI wrong. Therefore, after spending so much time learning the essence of storytelling, it was time to put my new and hopefully improved writing skills to the test. For those who have applied to a graduate program, you may know how daunting of a task it is to try and showcase all your accomplishments while trying to make a clear point. Especially with a finite word limitation, this challenge becomes even harder. Though I won't share the content of my essays on this blog (feel free to contact me individually for a copy of my statements), I do want to share my objectives I aimed for when writing these statements. Graudate school is notoriously difficult, so I wanted to demonstrate a time where I was challenged, but showed resolve and became a better person. In addition, I also wrote my traditional research statement, listing out previous experience. I remember re-reading these statements hundreds of times knowing that the words from my former PI was circulating in the back of my head. However at some point, re-reading the same thing over and over becsame impractical and I ended up submitting a few days before the deadline. 

Typically after the statements are reviewed by the department, the first pass candidates are asked to conduct an interview with numerous faculty memebers. I remember hearing back relatively quickly from the school, which made my heart skip to the beat of the drum, knowing my statements were good enough for a first pass. And from what I've read on Grad Cafe & Reddit, interviews were also usually an exclusive bunch encompassing roughly 20 students. When the day of the interview came, I was astonished to see that there were nearly 80 candidates on the Zoom call. This was obviously a blow to my confidence but also everyone's confidence, knowing that a majority of candidates made it to the second round. However, at this next stage, the mindset was to control what I can control, and present myself as someone who naturally fit in the program. It did make is difficult on a personal level however, because I saw two other students from the same program I had been in. It drew the line between friendship and competitor, but once again, I could only control what I could control. Another interesting aspect of these interviews was that we got to choose who interviewed us. We were asked by the department to select 4 professors that you would be interested in speaking with. Naturally I picked my former PI Jeff, along with Dr. Bruna Balliu, and was given Dr. Jessica Li and Dr. Tom Chou to round out my 4 interviewers. For the most part, my interviews went well, but there were also times where I stumbled. However there are two things which I believe ultimatley saved me and got me the acceptance to this program. One of them was mentioning the words "method development" which was what the program was transitioning towards. The department in general focuses alot on developing new methods, and by speaking those exact words, I think it helped form a promising match between the program and I.

The second reason I believe I was accepted was because I was able to meet one of the professors and give a presentation while she was on Sabatical at Harvard University. I had just moved to Boston at the time, and Professor Jessica Li was interested in hearing more about my work for a longer presentation in person. She therefore invited me to the Radcliffe Institute to give a mini seminar about some of my previous work and current works. This was both a daunting and exciting moment in my life, as it was an extension to my interview process, but also I would be giving my own talk at THE Harvard University. And in the seminar, came a barrage of questions from both her and her students, and while I did my best to answer them to the best of my knowledge, I had a bitter taste in my mouth of the overall experience. We talked about my academic journey afterwards and she told me that "if it didn't work out, to try again next year". I thought those words was a sign that it was a longshot that I got admitted but a few hours later was when I ultimately recieved an offer. Professor Jessica Li is a profound professor in the department and the coincidence that I got in shortly after giving this talk was second to none. Although I will never truly know how I got in, these two reasons are the story that I believe. And while this experience was very unique to myself, I thought it was worth mentioned regardless. So some general advice to prospective graduate students is to become both a great presenter & storyteller as these two components are critical to the graduate process.

### 2. Starting an Excercise Routine

The second highlight of the month was starting a gym routine. While this doesn't seem too significant compared to prior highlights, there were two reasons for such a simple highlight. The first reason was it was literally too damn cold in the month of February to enjoy the city of Boston. The second reason, was that I had so many previous friends who have tried to get me to commit to going to the gym but failed. However, mentally I wasn't in an absolute great place at the time and therefore gave it a try. 

One of my friends, Mikey at MIT, liked to power lift and do Judo. In the month of February, I spent significant time hanging out with Mikey, his girlfriend Soo, and their friends at MIT. Having spent a lot of time with them, I was also accustomed to their personal schedule which included an excessively long gym session nearly every day. Therefore we would usually hang out beginning at like 9pm, which was late in my opinion. However, since they were my direct social circle, I made it work. One time when I went over, they asked me why I didn't want to go to the gym with them, and to that I did not know. For so long, I have rejected the offers of my friends to join and train with them, that I felt like this was no different. However they listed out numerous perks to weight lifting in general which included: (INCLUDE THE BENEFITS OF WORKING OUT). For these reasons, I gave working out a try.
