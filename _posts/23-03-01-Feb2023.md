# General Updates

February was filled with really high and low moments. But like all things, this is a natural representation of the human experience. Before arriving to Boston, I was warned by family and friends, that Boston winters were brutal, and they were not joking. On February 4th, 2023, the whole east coast was hit with some pretty bad weather experiencing a terrible day where it hit a record low of -10 degrees farenheit. To my international folks that was a -23 degrees celsius. I remember that day vividly as I ended up walking to work with nearly 6 layers on and still feeling the harsh wind chills in my bones. I also didn't realize that anything below 0 degrees farenheit is considered dangerous and was therefore out in that weather like a silly goose. However, in some areas near Boston, it was far worse than anyone can imagaine. In Mt. Washington located in New Hamphsire it recorded a low of -108 farenheight including the wind chill and I couldn't imagine how freakishly cold that truly is considering I was struggling with the -23 celsius. But all in all, this was to prove that the winters in New England were truly brutal
