# Quote of the Monthly 

"There will likely be a day when the world stops and your heart breaks and you will need a vision of your life worth living that can survive the storm. Surely, your vision will be deepened, transformed, sharpened by the days on the pavement, but I hope your vision already has a compass that can orient you or, better yet, an anchor that will hold you" - Angela Williams Gorrell
