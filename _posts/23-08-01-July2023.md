# General Updates

The month of July brought along a string of unhurried moments. In a world where constant speed and connectivity dominate, I found solace in embracing a slower, more mindful way of living. It felt like a precious gift. Amidst the whirlwind of modern life, the concept of a "slow life" provided a comforting beacon. It was about relishing the small details, finding joy in the present, and appreciating simplicity.

For the first time in a very long while, I was granted a break. After deciding a few months ago to return to UCLA for graduate school, the choice proved to be the right one. Upon returning from Asia, I was swiftly immersed in a whirlwind, witnessing the company I had joined in January crumble. While a sense of guilt lingered for cutting short time with family and friends, the nature of the biotech industry unfolded. I also felt deep empathy for the incredible team I had been a part of. My tenure had been destined to end, but for them, an abrupt shift led to uncertainty ahead. Despite the heartache, it was the harsh reality of life, and I wished them all well.

In the midst of this month, I celebrated my birthday, an experience that felt surreal. I'll delve into the significance of this year later, but wow, what an incredible journey it has been. With ample time on my hands now, a fresh start has presented itself. This summer marked the first since my freshman year of college where I had no immediate plans or work obligations. It was a rare moment of sheer free time. Perhaps the universe was orchestrating its own design, allowing me a breather right before the demanding path of a Ph.D. beckons. Thus, this month was a paradox of sorts – seemingly uneventful yet profoundly meaningful. I am grateful for the long-awaited break I've yearned for, and it's a chapter I'll always remember.

# Top Three Highlights of the Month

### 1. Turning 22

This July, on the 11th, I marked my 22nd year. As I step into this new chapter, I find myself reflecting on the remarkable journey that 21 unfolded before me. Despite the trials that life presented, it undeniably stands as the most exceptional year of my life. Throughout its course, I've shared both highs and lows with you, and even amidst the challenges, I am certain that this has been the pinnacle of my existence thus far.

The onset of my 21st year played out like a scene from a movie. I couldn't have scripted a better start, surrounded by dear friends and realizing my dream birthday celebration. For the longest time, I resented having a summer birthday, as it often meant missing out on celebrating with all my friends. Though I still couldn't have everyone with me, I managed to unite my college pals and the summer research cohort in an unforgettable bash. My cherished companions surprised me with a cake, and we transformed our space into a lively celebration. There wasn't a single moment I didn't have a smile on my face. Amidst the revelry, there came a point when I slipped away from my own party to gaze at the sky and embrace the sheer beauty of life. My connection with the summer cohort remains an understatement; that core memory remains a cherished one, marking the advent of the extraordinary year that lay ahead.

After a delightful summer of fun in Los Angeles, I embarked on a journey that pushed me beyond my comfort zone – a move all the way to Switzerland. The urge to explore the world had intensified in me, especially in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Switzerland became my destination due to initial plans for a master's degree, but I swiftly realized it wasn't the right path for me. Despite this, I don't regret trying out education abroad; it provided invaluable insights into the type of academic environment that suits me best (hint: not one involving 7 graduate courses per semester). Beyond the rigorous academics, my time in Switzerland turned out to be a personal growth experience. Amidst facing instances of subtle racism and an unsettling incident in Paris, enduring a two-week period of homelessness, and navigating a language barrier, there's nothing quite like my absurd daily commute across Lac Leman (Lake Leman) via ferry to school. Though it was undoubtedly a struggle at the time, I can now look back and chuckle at those moments. Dealing with seasonal depression, an unbalanced diet that led to significant weight loss, and a touch of homesickness, I came to realize that life has its ups and downs, and tough times eventually fade. Fortunately, destiny smiled on me – landing a job in Boston meant bidding farewell to school, opening up the opportunity to travel and embark on a fresh adventure on the East Coast.

When I secured the job, I swiftly packed my bags and headed to the Czech Republic for a trip with my long-time high school friend, Josh Moon. During this time, I made up for the lackluster social scene I experienced in Switzerland and indulged in the genuine European clubbing atmosphere. It was a joy to reconnect with an old friend and explore the country together. Apart from the Czech Republic, I also traveled around Switzerland and even found the opportunity to venture to Africa. Visiting Africa had been a longstanding dream, and the chance to camp for four days in the Sahara Desert, starting from Marrakesh, Morocco, was an opportunity I couldn't pass up. Those days became a beautiful memory shared with people from around the world, encapsulating the spirit of Morocco. Just before bidding adieu to Europe, I forged strong friendships that compensated for the lackluster social experiences in Switzerland. Spending quality time with Helena, Kem, Lina, and Jeannine made leaving this country a bittersweet farewell. The theme of seizing life's wild moments continued to unfold during this remarkable 21st year.

As the holiday season approached, I embarked on an impromptu trip to visit my now ex-girlfriend, someone I deeply cared for at the time. Despite my dream of reuniting with her while in Europe, by the time I could make it happen, circumstances had changed. Amidst the chill of winter, I realized the importance of valuing people and moments in the present, and not clinging to who they were in the past. Yet, this heartache was short-lived as I journeyed back to Germany to conclude my stay, visiting a dear friend, Philippa Steinburg, and her family in her hometown of Hamburg. Our conversations about life brought me solace, reassuring me of the supportive network I had. From there, I welcomed the new year with resolutions and a truly fresh start.

After a tumultuous flight from Hamburg to Turkey and finally to Boston, my new life on the East Coast commenced. Adjusting to the New England area took time, but I was content to have a fresh beginning, this time back in the US. As I stepped into what I believed to be my dream industry, I gained insights into the sometimes monotonous nature of adult life. My time in Boston highlighted that social interactions and meaningful connections required intentional planning. I ventured into the realm of dating, going on around 30 dates with the aim of finding companionship and friendship. Initially, making friends seemed relatively easy, especially after meeting Lauren, who became both my longest-standing friend and my first date in Boston. However, the journey taught me that cultivating friendships wasn't as straightforward as I thought. Eventually, in April, I struck gold when I met Camilla, who introduced me to my Harvard friend group through a series of serendipitous events. As the semester ended and summer approached, my own break began. I took a hiatus from work to travel to Japan, exploring most of the country's western region from Tokyo and forming friendships along the way. Before returning to the US to celebrate my 22nd birthday, I embarked on a visit to Taiwan, a tale I'll delve into more in the next highlight.

I recall spending my 22nd birthday this year mostly sleeping due to jet lag, which felt symbolic after a year filled with adventure. I managed to fulfill one of my goals by traversing the globe, building an extensive network, and embracing countless opportunities I might have passed up on from before. This version of me, characterized by ambition and a thirst for experiences, was fully realized, and I'm eager to continue living a life that I love and find joy in every day. While I'll miss many things from this year, I'm equally thrilled to step into year 22 of my young and ongoing narrative, a tale still unfolding.

# Quote of the Monthly 

"There will likely be a day when the world stops and your heart breaks and you will need a vision of your life worth living that can survive the storm. Surely, your vision will be deepened, transformed, sharpened by the days on the pavement, but I hope your vision already has a compass that can orient you or, better yet, an anchor that will hold you" - Angela Williams Gorrell
