The month of July brought along a string of unhurried moments. In a world where constant speed and connectivity dominate, I found solace in embracing a slower, more mindful way of living. It felt like a precious gift. Amidst the whirlwind of modern life, the concept of a "slow life" provided a comforting beacon. It was about relishing the small details, finding joy in the present, and appreciating simplicity.

For the first time in a very long while, I was granted a break. After deciding a few months ago to return to UCLA for graduate school, the choice proved to be the right one. Upon returning from Asia, I was swiftly immersed in a whirlwind, witnessing the company I had joined in January crumble. While a sense of guilt lingered for cutting short time with family and friends, the nature of the biotech industry unfolded. I also felt deep empathy for the incredible team I had been a part of. My tenure had been destined to end, but for them, an abrupt shift led to uncertainty ahead. Despite the heartache, it was the harsh reality of life, and I wished them all well.

In the midst of this month, I celebrated my birthday, an experience that felt surreal. I'll delve into the significance of this year later, but wow, what an incredible journey it has been. With ample time on my hands now, a fresh start has presented itself. This summer marked the first since my freshman year of college where I had no immediate plans or work obligations. It was a rare moment of sheer free time. Perhaps the universe was orchestrating its own design, allowing me a breather right before the demanding path of a Ph.D. beckons. Thus, this month was a paradox of sorts – seemingly uneventful yet profoundly meaningful. I am grateful for the long-awaited break I've yearned for, and it's a chapter I'll always remember.

# Top Three Highlights of the Month

### 1. Turning 22

This July, on the 11th, I marked my 22nd year. As I step into this new chapter, I find myself reflecting on the remarkable journey that 21 unfolded before me. Despite the trials that life presented, it undeniably stands as the most exceptional year of my life. Throughout its course, I've shared both highs and lows with you, and even amidst the challenges, I am certain that this has been the pinnacle of my existence thus far.

The onset of my 21st year played out like a scene from a movie. I couldn't have scripted a better start, surrounded by dear friends and realizing my dream birthday celebration. For the longest time, I resented having a summer birthday, as it often meant missing out on celebrating with all my friends. Though I still couldn't have everyone with me, I managed to unite my college pals and the summer research cohort in an unforgettable bash. My cherished companions surprised me with a cake, and we transformed our space into a lively celebration. There wasn't a single moment I didn't have a smile on my face. Amidst the revelry, there came a point when I slipped away from my own party to gaze at the sky and embrace the sheer beauty of life. My connection with the summer cohort remains an understatement; that core memory remains a cherished one, marking the advent of the extraordinary year that lay ahead.

After a delightful summer of fun in Los Angeles, I embarked on a journey that pushed me beyond my comfort zone – a move all the way to Switzerland. The urge to explore the world had intensified in me, especially in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Switzerland became my destination due to initial plans for a master's degree, but I swiftly realized it wasn't the right path for me. Despite this, I don't regret trying out education abroad; it provided invaluable insights into the type of academic environment that suits me best (hint: not one involving 7 graduate courses per semester). Beyond the rigorous academics, my time in Switzerland turned out to be a personal growth experience. Amidst facing instances of subtle racism and an unsettling incident in Paris, enduring a two-week period of homelessness, and navigating a language barrier, there's nothing quite like my absurd daily commute across Lac Leman (Lake Leman) via ferry to school. Though it was undoubtedly a struggle at the time, I can now look back and chuckle at those moments. Dealing with seasonal depression, an unbalanced diet that led to significant weight loss, and a touch of homesickness, I came to realize that life has its ups and downs, and tough times eventually fade. Fortunately, destiny smiled on me – landing a job in Boston meant bidding farewell to school, opening up the opportunity to travel and embark on a fresh adventure on the East Coast.

When I secured the job, I swiftly packed my bags and headed to the Czech Republic for a trip with my long-time high school friend, Josh Moon. During this time, I made up for the lackluster social scene I experienced in Switzerland and indulged in the genuine European clubbing atmosphere. It was a joy to reconnect with an old friend and explore the country together. Apart from the Czech Republic, I also traveled around Switzerland and even found the opportunity to venture to Africa. Visiting Africa had been a longstanding dream, and the chance to camp for four days in the Sahara Desert, starting from Marrakesh, Morocco, was an opportunity I couldn't pass up. Those days became a beautiful memory shared with people from around the world, encapsulating the spirit of Morocco. Just before bidding adieu to Europe, I forged strong friendships that compensated for the lackluster social experiences in Switzerland. Spending quality time with Helena, Kem, Lina, and Jeannine made leaving this country a bittersweet farewell. The theme of seizing life's wild moments continued to unfold during this remarkable 21st year.

As the holiday season approached, I embarked on an impromptu trip to visit my now ex-girlfriend, someone I deeply cared for at the time. Despite my dream of reuniting with her while in Europe, by the time I could make it happen, circumstances had changed. Amidst the chill of winter, I realized the importance of valuing people and moments in the present, and not clinging to who they were in the past. Yet, this heartache was short-lived as I journeyed back to Germany to conclude my stay, visiting a dear friend, Philippa Steinburg, and her family in her hometown of Hamburg. Our conversations about life brought me solace, reassuring me of the supportive network I had. From there, I welcomed the new year with resolutions and a truly fresh start.

After a tumultuous flight from Hamburg to Turkey and finally to Boston, my new life on the East Coast commenced. Adjusting to the New England area took time, but I was content to have a fresh beginning, this time back in the US. As I stepped into what I believed to be my dream industry, I gained insights into the sometimes monotonous nature of adult life. My time in Boston highlighted that social interactions and meaningful connections required intentional planning. I ventured into the realm of dating, going on around 30 dates with the aim of finding companionship and friendship. Initially, making friends seemed relatively easy, especially after meeting Lauren, who became both my longest-standing friend and my first date in Boston. However, the journey taught me that cultivating friendships wasn't as straightforward as I thought. Eventually, in April, I struck gold when I met Camilla, who introduced me to my Harvard friend group through a series of serendipitous events. As the semester ended and summer approached, my own break began. I took a hiatus from work to travel to Japan, exploring most of the country's western region from Tokyo and forming friendships along the way. Before returning to the US to celebrate my 22nd birthday, I embarked on a visit to Taiwan, a tale I'll delve into more in the next highlight.

I recall spending my 22nd birthday this year mostly sleeping due to jet lag, which felt symbolic after a year filled with adventure. I managed to fulfill one of my goals by traversing the globe, building an extensive network, and embracing countless opportunities I might have passed up on from before. This version of me, characterized by ambition and a thirst for experiences, was fully realized, and I'm eager to continue living a life that I love and find joy in every day. While I'll miss many things from this year, I'm equally thrilled to step into year 22 of my young and ongoing narrative, a tale still unfolding.

### 2. Taiwan & Joanne

### Day 1

The second highlight of the month involves the tail end of my Japan trip, where I made an impromptu plan to visit Taiwan as well. Flights to Asia are so expensive nowadays, that it doesn't hurt to fly to other neighboring countries across the Pacific Ocean. I had preliminary plans and a high level of interest in visiting China, but due to my lack lackadaisical lifestyle and my mere opposition to be proactive, this became impossible. China remains one of the few countries where a visa is required, and I was glad to have known that instead of inadvertintly traveling there just to be sent home. However even after China, I had also had some thoughts about going to Thailand before Taiwan had ever crossed my mind. I ultimately did not go to Thailand though because it sounded brutally hot, and there were a lot of terrifying animals that sounded deadly (e.g. King Cobra...). Therefore with Thailand officially crossed out, I made my way to the just as hot country of Taiwan, specifically Taipei. 

As mentioned previously, I tend to be lacksadasical when it comes to planning things out when on vacation. But in my perspective, planning nothing vs having a deep itinerary is easier since you can never really account for the unexpected events that travel brings. And Taiwan was no different. I was told that most people in Taiwan spoke English, but this was blatantly not true. It wasn't necessarily an issue but it did make for a harder time. When I had first landed in Taiwan, I also did not give a single glance to my hotel's location and didn't realize that the commute from the airport was going to be roughly 30 minutes via the bus. To be honest that isn't terrible on any standard for public transportation but since the bus would not take credit card, things started to go down hill really quickly. After failing multiple times, I tried to just bank on the fact that the bus rider would let me on for free because it cost maybe equivalent to $1 USD, but the bus driver proceeded to cuss me out in Mandarin moments later. Therefore at the next stop, I was booted off with all my stuff in the midst of a 100 degree day with nearly 100% humidity. I reconfigured the route to my hotel from my current location to find out it would take roughly 2 hours via walking. I had somewhat no choice so I made the long sweaty journey ahead. 

After arriving at my hotel, I was pretty exhausted from the heat and proceeded to skip lunch that day. The area I was had little to no foreigners in plain sight, and I still was yet to grab any cash in a cash based country. After rejuvinating myself, I proceeded to visit the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall which was one of the closest landmarks near me. I had made the decision again to walk to this site because walking is an underrated form of commute when traveling. When you walk you are able to go through streets and small places where you wouldn't have been able to see if you had taken the metro or bus. On these walks, I observed the endless people riding motorcycles, the cockroaches, and the aroma of delicious foods all around me. Though the country felt a little dirty, it was beautiful in its own right. Upon arriving to the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall, you were immersed into a very elegant set of architecture that embelished a chinese-esque culture. 

The Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall, an iconic landmark situated in the heart of Taipei, stands as a testament to the historical and political significance of Taiwan. This majestic structure, completed in 1980, honors the legacy of Chiang Kai-shek, the prominent leader who played a pivotal role in shaping Taiwan's modern history. The memorial hall's imposing white facade, flanked by grand staircases and encompassed by lush gardens, serves as a focal point for both locals and visitors alike. Its solemnity is further heightened by the changing of the guard ceremony that takes place regularly at the main entrance. Within the hall, a larger-than-life bronze statue of Chiang Kai-shek is prominently displayed, surrounded by exhibits detailing his life and the broader history of Taiwan. Beyond its historical importance, the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall has become an emblem of Taiwan's evolving identity, offering a space for reflection, education, and cultural gatherings that resonate with the nation's past and its aspirations for the future. I spent the afternoon walking around this structure to simply enjoy the new culture around me.

After checking out the historic site, I would head back to my hotel once more before meeting up with one of the friends I was too meet in Taipei, Joanne Hsieh. I won't even mention how I met her because if you've been keeping up, its obvious how I meet all my friends but Joanne was a local of Taiwan who could speak a slight bit of Taiwanese and Mandarin that would help me navigate the city during my visit. We had elected for an early dinner since I didn't eat anything all day, and went to the infamous Din Tai Fung restaurant. Among the many popular cuisine that Taiwan had to offer, Dim Sum at Din Tai Fung is a must. We also just so happened to be at the most touristy restaurant located inside the Taipei 101 building, so it made for a fun and elegant dinner. Joanne and I were the same age, and she was a total absolute sweetheart. She grew up in Taiwan for some of her life before moving to Knoxville Tennessee, where she currently resides. But every summer their family returns to Taiwan just because it feels more like home than Tennessee. She was currently in the process of studying chemical engineering, where she hopes to hopefully attend Georgia Tech (Though I am trying to heavily influence her to apply to UCLA as well). But among all the things I found great about her, I appreciated her flexibility and ambitious nature of her wanting to really do anything I wanted to do. It is really hard to find people like that in this day and age and I appreciated her for those traits.

That same day was the 4th of July so after eating a heavy dinner, we proceeded to go and check out some of the nightlife in the area. But before that we happened to actually go the top of the Taipei 101 tower and enjoy the 360 degree view of the city. Taipei 101, a towering architectural marvel that once held the title of the world's tallest building, transforms into a vibrant and enchanting hub of nightlife as the sun sets over Taipei. The skyscraper's glittering facade, illuminated by a dazzling array of lights, casts a mesmerizing glow across the cityscape. Its surroundings come alive with a dynamic energy as locals and tourists alike gather to experience Taipei's captivating night scene. From chic rooftop bars offering panoramic views of the city's twinkling lights to bustling night markets bustling with delectable street food and local crafts, Taipei 101's vicinity becomes a playground of exploration after dark. The upscale shopping and entertainment complex within the tower itself buzzes with activity, welcoming night owls to indulge in late-night shopping, world-class dining, and sophisticated lounges. Whether savoring a gourmet meal, embracing the city's electrifying nightlife, or simply reveling in the magnetic ambiance, Taipei 101 stands at the heart of a nocturnal adventure that embodies the city's modernity and vitality. Joanne would take me to this bar where we got to continue to know one another as we enjoyed drinks at one of the rooftop bars. All in all, it was an eventful 4th of July and I was really happy I met Joanne. And I guess I was cool enough to the point where she dropped her dinner plans with her family to go out and show me around the city again.

### Day 2

Day 2 started off pretty high energy because I was hungover. Usually your blood pressure is low when your hungover but the reason this morning was different was because we would find a cockroach on my hotel room floor. I hate little critters in general so I was tweaking pretty bad. Cockroaches are pretty much found everywhere in Taiwan, but you hate to see these little guys be in your literal hotel room... In that moment, my hair was in dissaray, I didn't have clothes on, and I was still processing waking up but I began to inch my way towards my luggage, get dressed, and immediatley call room service to help me with this ordeal. Funny enough, the room service lady again did not understand English whatsoever, so trying to communicate her via sounds and gestures was a humerous way to begin my morning in itself. Luckily the cockroach accepted his fate, and was killed nearly effortlessly by the room service lady. After that whole fiasco, I just wanted to sleep some more but was interrupted soon after by room service who kicked me out later. However it was in my best interest to get my day started and explore more of what the city had to offer.

Today, Joanne and I had plans to visit some type of flower museum, in addition to checking out some of the night markets which was one of Taiwans many landmarks. In this time we got to know each other better while enjoying some Taiwanese Hot Pot. After a very filling lunch, we proceeded to make our way north of the city to Miramar Entertainment District to go check out the flower museum. Funny enough the flower museum maybe took like 5 minutes to see the whole exhibit but it was indeed pretty. There were a ton of flowers put into these transparent rocks or glass that made viewing these plants very elegant. After walking through the museum, we had severly overpredicted the amount of time that museum would take so we had some down time before heading to the night markets. Therefore we went to the top of this mall area, ate some gelato and just talked more about life with one another. Weirdly enough, I find having deep conversations with strangers to be more comforting than just a normal friend. Since they hardly know anything about you, there never seems to be any toward of bias in what they have to say. I really enjoyed my time with Joanne, and getting to know the person behind the pretty face was comforting.

At last when the temperature went below 90 degrees, we proceeded to make our way to the Raohe Night Market to go and try out all sorts of local cuisine. But before we devoured some food, we stopped by the Songshan Ciyou Temple to again endulge in some of the culture around us. Cities baffle me in a way because in the midst of a bustling city, you find preserved buildings with years of history, and Taiwan was no different. Songshan Ciyou Temple, a cultural and spiritual gem nestled within the bustling urban landscape of Taipei, holds a special place in Taiwan's rich heritage. Built in 1753, this historical Taoist temple boasts intricate architectural details and vibrant colors that captivate the senses. Dedicated to the goddess Mazu, the protector of seafarers, the temple stands as a testament to Taiwan's maritime roots. Its ornate interior features intricately carved wooden beams, exquisite porcelain figurines, and elaborate frescoes that depict scenes from Chinese mythology. Beyond its artistic allure, Songshan Ciyou Temple serves as a tranquil oasis amidst the city's modern hustle and bustle, offering visitors a serene space for reflection and prayer. The temple's role in Taiwanese culture is exemplified during its annual grand procession, where devotees carry the deity's statue through the streets, accompanied by lively performances and traditional rituals. This captivating blend of history, artistry, and devotion makes Songshan Ciyou Temple a cherished cultural landmark that bridges the past and the present, embodying the spiritual essence of Taipei's diverse identity.

Alas, we were steps away from the Raohe Night Market and we tried all sorts of local cuisine. Truth is for the longest time, I was a picky eater, but since picking up this hobby to travel, it is hard to be a picky eater. But this was not all that bad because, I feel more acclimated into a place when I am able to try the local dishes and it has presented me with many interesting cuisines that I otherwise would have never tried. Some of the foods we tried were Chen Tung Herbal Pork Ribs Medicinal Herbs Soup, Stinky Tofu from world famous Ming Peng Xia Gang, Fuzhou Shizu Pepper Cake, Red Braised beef Noodles (Taiwanese Ramen), Hot Tangyuan, papaya Milkshake, and a Taiwanese style hot dog whose buns were made out of rice. We tried all sorts of dishes that way and it was an especially lovely experience with someone who was able to speak Taiwanese. I was greatful to have been helped around by Joanne, and it made for a very hectic yet eventful day. We finished off the day by walking along the river and listening to Kpop as we enjoyed just a normal summer night in Taiwan. Spending time with Joanne has made me want to embrace in my Korean roots more because we had a running joke that she was more Korean than me. We walked back towards the metro and said our goodbyes shortly after. I was going to miss Joanne but promised to come see her soon.

# Day 3

In my final full day in Taiwan, I was going to go explore Jiufen a city north of Taipei. Perched atop the lush mountains, Jiufen is a captivating village that weaves together history, culture, and breathtaking scenery. With its narrow labyrinthine streets, quaint tea houses, and traditional red lanterns hanging overhead, Jiufen exudes an old-world charm that transports visitors to a bygone era. The village's origins trace back to the gold rush days of the 19th century, and remnants of its mining heritage can be seen in its architecture and atmosphere. Beyond its historic allure, Jiufen boasts panoramic vistas of the Pacific Ocean, offering a mesmerizing contrast between the tranquility of the mountains and the vast expanse of water below. Its bustling night market entices with an array of local delicacies and crafts, while the iconic A-Mei Tea House, inspired by the acclaimed filmmaker Hayao Miyazaki's works, adds a touch of whimsy to the town's ambiance. Jiufen's unique blend of nostalgia, natural beauty, and artistic inspiration make it a cherished destination that captures the essence of Taiwan's cultural and geographical diversity.

{% include figure image_path="/images/post_photos/july2023/13.JPG" alt="this is a placeholder image" caption="Jiufen" %}

As mentioned in the previous paragraph, this place had a rich history as was once beloved by the people of Japan. So much so that Hayao Miyazaki a.k.a the Ghibli creator had modeled the Spirited Away movie at this city. And while I love that movie, I had no idea where the resemblence was coming from. Regardless, in my time there, I checked out the scenic views from the mountain city but spent the majority of my time doing a Taiwanese Tea Service at that infamous A-Mei Tea House. It was quite the beautiful structure with a beautiful ocean view, and at this place they taught me how to properly prepare Oolong Tea from the raw leaves themselves. It was an elegant experience overall and I made my way back to Taipei that evening.

On my final night, I decided to go out to the Taipei 101 area one last time, where I would enjoy a Tepanyaki style dinner. One of the many things I love about Asia, is that the food is cheap relative to our currency, so we are able to either dine for ridiculously cheap as in the case of the Night markets, or you can go to a nice fine dine-esque style dinner for an absolute bargain. I ordered a combintation of a surf and turf type dinner, and it was a great final dinner in Taipei. After doing so, I checked out the nightlife scene one last time since it was a Friday, and saw quite the crowd at one of the clubs. When I asked what was going on, we were suddenly reeled into an eventful night because the DJ Slander was performing here in Taiwan. Therefore I made some brand new friends, none of which whose names I remember but we drank alot, allegedley watched Slander, and I remember I ran back to my hotel while being really drunk. A 2 hour walk felt like minutes as I was having quite the time of my life. At some point I was also facetiming Joanne, and had formed yet another marriage pact in Taiwan. This marriage pact seemed to be jokingly serious and we still text each other pretending we are going to marry one another. After I fell asleep from exhaustion, that basically wrapped up my short stay in Taiwan. I came in knowing absolutley nothing but left with many eventful experiences, and an alleged wife when we both turn 30. This was again a fun little side quest in a year full of many side quests, and I felt lucky and grateful to be able to travel to the ridiculously humid, hot, but cultural country of Taiwan.

### 3. Climbing Mount Fuji

The last highlight of this month featured a long life time goal that I was able to cross off my TODO list. 


# One thing I learned this Month

# Quote of the Monthly 

"There will likely be a day when the world stops and your heart breaks and you will need a vision of your life worth living that can survive the storm. Surely, your vision will be deepened, transformed, sharpened by the days on the pavement, but I hope your vision already has a compass that can orient you or, better yet, an anchor that will hold you" - Angela Williams Gorrell
