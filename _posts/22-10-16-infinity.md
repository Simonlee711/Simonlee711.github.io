I just finished watching an incredible documentary about infinity. However it first leads to the question: what is inifnity? A number, a concept, a spatial or temporal domain? The answer I guess is dependent on who we are talking to. So the next question that comes to mind is can we visualize infinity? I will provide a mathematical example.

\\[ \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{16} ... \frac{1}{2^{n}} = 1\\]

If you add an infinite sequence of this given equation you will always end up at one. If you have ever taken Calculus, you should be able to detect that this is a convergent series. Meaning that adding an infinite amount of numbers will sum to a finite number. However lets look at its counterpart: divergent series. If we add the following:

\\[ 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 ... n = \inf \\]
