This is a hard read because it is technical but I tried to explain it as simple as possible. I also think this is one of the most interesting blog posts so even if its hard and long, I recommend you read through the whole thing.

# Introduction

<image src="/images/space.gif" alt="Spinners" width="650"  /> 

I just finished watching an incredible documentary about infinity. However it first leads to the question: what is inifnity? A number, a concept, a spatial or temporal domain? The answer I guess is dependent on who we are talking to. So the next question that comes to mind is can we visualize infinity? I will provide a mathematical example.

\\[ \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{16} ... + \frac{1}{2^{n}} = 1\\]

If you add an infinite sequence of this given equation you will always end up at one. If you have ever taken Calculus, you should be able to detect that this is a convergent series. Meaning that adding an infinite amount of numbers will sum to a finite number. However lets look at its counterpart: divergent series. If we add the following we should get infinity:

\\[ 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 ... + n = \infty \\]

Now lets take it a step further by taking our sum and adding 1 to it. We should get some sequence like this 

\\[ \infty + 1 = \infty \\]

However this is a paradox. Let me demonstrate why. If we were to subtract infinity from both sides now we get a famous mathematical expression:

\\[ 1 = 0 \\]

This makes no sense. In fact a lot of things do not make any feasible sense in the concept of infinity and it can often lead to existential spirals of thoughts. I thought it would therefore be interesting to present some of the things I learned from this documentary and hurt your head! So get ready to dive into some physics, permutations, and existential life as we know it.

# The ∞ Hotel Paradox

Suppose we have a hotel that can fit an infinite amount of people. However this special hotel has some rules you should know before you proceed. The hotel is always full. However there is also always space for new customers... So if a new customer wanted to stay the night at the hotel everyone would move to room number \\( n+1 \\), where n is there current hotel number. Sounds easy enough right. The next evening, an infinite amount of people want an infinite amount of rooms to stay since the hotel always has free space. However the customers will not move \\( n+ \infty \\) rooms. Instead there is a even more clever solution: \\( n * 2 \\). So if you were at room 1 you would move to room 2, 2->4, 3->6, 4->8, and it goes on and on and on. What did you just do? You freed up every odd hotel room and now there is an infinite amount of rooms for the infinite amount of customers. Well done. Some people have proposed the idea that perhaps appending the new customers to \\( \infty \\) just seems easier and must more simple. However the issue with this approach is that know one knows where the end of the hotel aka room infinity is. Therefore since it is not a finite quantity, this approach will never work. This leads us to the idea that not all infinities are the same, which is also something we learned in calculus. This idea of infinity is starting to become scary and its only about to get worse.

# ∞ is small

Typically we think that infinity is a large quantity. However let me demonstrate to you that infinity can also be a small quantity. How many numbers lie between 100 and 101? Thats right its infinite. If we visualized numbers like the data structure, stack, if we keep pushing on 0 to the top of of our stack, there is an infinite amount of quanitites that lie between these numbers (i.e 0.00001, 0.0000000000001,...). So how do we control infinity if it is both incredibly large and small at the same time?

# Calculus

Calculus is hard, confusing, and it was not one of my favorite subjects in high school. However maturing is knowing that everything that changes is modeled through calculus. Whether its movement, a complex system, or even how electricity works, we need calculus to make sense of it. So based off our defintion we can use calculus to control infinity. After all we as a mathematician, we know that something exists if you can observe it and constrain it using a set of tools. Calculus is that tool. So lets say we have a curve that models the position the earth is around the sun. We can model the orbit or the curve as an infinitely discretized set of lines that give us a "orbital feature". If we constrained our elliptic behavior to be  \\( n = 5 \\) lines, we would have a very bumpy pentagon like orbit around the sun. But with this infinite discretization, we can model any rotation and even curve all revolving around our time constant. And what makes this infinite discretization awesome is that we can simplify complex systems. Take for example a fourier series [1]. In simple terms a fourier series is an infinite amount of sines and cosines summed together to form any waveform possible. Using the power of fourier series and the amount of times it take to get through one cycle, mathematicians have been able to concatenate a whole bunch of different series to draw pictures using these fourier series... simply INCREDIBLE.
