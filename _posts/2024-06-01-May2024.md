Like every month at this point, May was a busy one. Sometimes the world feels like there is not enough time to accomplish the things you want to do. But that is okay and that is life. However as a Ph.D. student, I am really testing my limits to see how much I can handle in the span of 5 years. While life has been very exhilirating and eventful, it has also been a lot of pressure and pain in the sense that I don't have enough time to do all the things I want to. However this is just the reality of my situtation. My goal is to just do my best and if thats not enough than oh well...

This month there are no highlights.
