EPFL is a world renowned engineering university and interestingly enough they also have a passion for business. Upon my arrival into this brand new education system, they have made intellectual property and business skills a high priority. I am unaware if this is a cultural difference or simply a university specific difference but it has been an interesting aspect of my education that I did not intially intend to know or learn about. 

One of the common themes within the classroom has been about encouragment of start-up companies and business pitches. Especially in both my biology and computer science courses, it has an extra emphasis on these themes. This is because biotech and tech in general are the current waves within our economy. 

In addition to the business aspect of things, experiencing a brand new education system has also been quite eye-opening. Switzerland has a shocking 51% passing rate amongst 1st year bachelors students due to their system. Unlike the US, if you have a high school diploma, you are free to go to any univeristy you like. However as a form of filtering, the two famous Swiss univerisities EPFL and ETH have the highest fail rate amongst their students. A lot of students fail because the workload is far more than a full time job in the USA. For example I am currently taking 32 ECT's or units because that is deemed the standard at EPFL. The expectation is to work double the amount of ECT's in hours per week. This means I have to work around 64 hours in a week to keep up with all the curriculum. So students who go to school at EPFL have to go through many years of an intense workload.

This education system is far more intense and I think it's been an interesting aspect to see since moving here.
