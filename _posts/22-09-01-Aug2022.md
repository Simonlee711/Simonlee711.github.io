August was the start of something very new. What felt like months in the making, the time had finally come for me to begin my next journey from graduation. The final days in Los Angeles felt both saddenning and exciting as my next journey awaited me. But enough of the suspense, let me just tell you what is going on. I was on my way to moving abroad to Switzerland to begin my graduate studies. It was a nostalgic moment for me because I was returning to the country I remembered loving when I was just 10 years old. Now 10-ish years later, I was returning all grown up to take this next step towards adulthood. 

COVID-19 had played a huge role in my decision to leave the country. After feeling isolated and stuck in the same place for so long, it was finally time to spread my wings and leave California and see what the world had to offer. My senior year was filled with many memorable memories, but I knew so much more was awaiting in Switzerland. Moving to a new place is never easy but starting over is not an opportunity that comes around often. My good friend/ex-girlfriend Alex Pavy had told me that "I could be whoever I wanted to be" and I took those words to heart. It began in the summer, and it was going to continue as I was able to reinvent the person I once was and present myself as the person I truly wanted to be. 

Internally, I was feeling nervous. But moving to another country offers a multitude of benefits that deeply enrich one's life. Immersing oneself in a different culture, language, and way of life not only broadens horizons but also fosters a greater understanding of the world's diversity. This exposure cultivates empathy and tolerance towards different viewpoints, while the challenges of adapting to unfamiliar situations spark personal growth, resilience, and problem-solving skills. Beyond personal development, living abroad enhances language proficiency through daily interactions, promoting effective communication and cross-cultural connections. Additionally, exposure to global art, cuisine, and traditions enriches one's cultural appreciation, inspiring creativity and a broader worldview.

Moreover, the practical advantages of relocating are noteworthy. Certain countries offer better economic prospects, including job opportunities, higher salaries, or a lower cost of living. As for Switzerland, part of the reason I chose to attend graduate school there was because tuition was less than ~$1000 USD per semester. The international experience gained is also highly regarded by employers and colleagues, showcasing adaptability and a diverse skill set. Lastly, moving abroad facilitates the building of an international network through connections with people from various backgrounds. These relationships not only lead to lasting friendships but also offer insights into different industries and lifestyles, further contributing to a more well-rounded and fulfilled life.

I was therefore excited to begin this new life that awaits me, and I look forward to sharing the many stories that will come from the next 2 years abroad.

# Top Three Highlights of the Month

### 1. The Most Beautiful Day of my Life (so far!)

Before introducing Europe into the narrative, I believe it's fitting to commence by recounting several highlights from my concluding days in Los Angeles. One of the central themes of this month was bidding adieu. Farewells have never been my strong suit, and relinquishing my connection with Noelle Wheeler, my girlfriend at the time, proved to be particularly challenging. Describing the significance of Noelle throughout the summer is a daunting task. While senior year was punctuated with numerous standout moments, it also held its moments of introspection. Yet, Noelle played a pivotal role in steering me away from that, and for that, I extend my sincere gratitude. The summer was marked by countless shared escapades that solidified her place as not just my dearest friend, but also the quintessential companion. Her unwavering presence, irrespective of the context, was a rarity that I deeply cherished.

Many cherished recollections revolve around her; it was as if we were peas in a pod, an analogy made famous by Forrest Gump. Our proximity in the same lab space throughout the summer kept us nearly inseparable, save for sleep. Yet, if I had to isolate one single moment from the summer, it would undoubtedly be the day her car broke down. Occurring on a workday, close to 2 am, I adamantly refused to leave her side as we awaited AAA's arrival to jump-start her car. Though spending such prolonged hours with someone might typically elicit discomfort, with her, everything felt effortlessly organic. However, all good things inevitably conclude. In this scenario, the endpoint was swiftly encroaching. As incoming graduate students in the field of bioinformatics, our futures were destined to diverge across an ocean. While I was bound for Switzerland, she was en route to Cornell Weill Medical School in the East.

Noelle's brilliance was undeniable. Beyond her already remarkable mindset, she embodied exceptional intelligence coupled with a profound and affectionate disposition. There was little left to desire from an individual. Yet, as the realities of our approaching futures loomed, the inevitable discussion of what lay ahead was inescapable. Guided by our best interests and the desire to forge ahead, I made the arduous choice that we should part ways once summer came to an end. She acquiesced, and the resolution was firmly established. Upon reflection, I am convinced this was in the best interest of both parties. Life presents numerous instances where "what if" scenarios arise, but to propel ourselves forward, I genuinely perceived no alternative.

On our final day at UCLA, after bidding farewell to the remarkable cohort that had shared our summer, Noelle and I found ourselves as the last remaining individuals, taking one last leisurely stroll around the picturesque campus. Amidst a palpable tension, following our goodbyes to everyone else, the awareness of our imminent farewell cast its shadow. Suddenly, she posed an unexpected question, her voice quivering with emotion, inquiring if my feelings for her had ever been genuine. This inquiry shattered me; its unexpectedness struck a deep chord, considering the immense emotional investment I had made. Tears welled in my eyes as we confronted the reality that the following day marked the commencement of a lengthy separation. The moment fostered a brief dispute, perhaps a means of coping with the impending separation. Releasing someone of her caliber was undoubtedly painful, yet it underscored the extraordinary nature of our bond. Despite the anguish that enveloped us that day, it crystallized how a single individual possesses the potential to transform us for the better. Up to that point, I had never encountered someone so perfectly compatible, and she unveiled the boundless capacity for happiness within me. Every emotion was heightened; it served as a testament to my reluctance to let go. It symbolized the conclusion of an era, albeit accompanied by the understanding that my departure from this place was marked by an amicable parting. Recognizing the equilibrium I had established in her heart rendered that night the most beautiful day of my life. Though tears flowed for hours, they underscored the profound bond connecting the two of us.

Writing this is particularly hard knowing that things were bound to change. But in that moment I was confident that I loved Noelle Wheeler with my whole heart and I had never met a person that I had cared for more than her. To those who may read this in the future, please understand that these sentiments were genuinely felt at that time, although I implore you not to hold me indefinitely to them. The journey ahead undoubtedly poses challenges, but I find solace in the fact that I left this relationship on positive terms, rather than following the conventional path of a breakup rooted in a particular issue. Farewell to my Noel-E; that concludes that chapter <\3..

### 2. Saying Farewell

An equally challenging task was bidding farewell to all the lovely friends I had made at UCLA. It was so tough knowing that there was a low probability chance that we would all again meet in one place altogether. And for me, I didn't know when I would see these people again for that matter. I want to keep this section brief because it is really redundant from the previous section but it truly sucks to say farewell.
