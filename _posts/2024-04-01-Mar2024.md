# Top ~~Three~~ Highlights of the Month

### 1. Dubai

# One thing I learned this Month

### "Be Grateful"

This month, towards the end, I spoke with one of the friends I made over the quarter: Kaylyn Phan. She is an incredibly smart individual, graduating just like me in just three years. She studies computer science and is off to Meta after completing her degree this coming spring semester. We met in a computer science course and sat next to each other nearly the whole quarter and she was one of the few classmates that I got to know since my return to school. She works extremely hard and truth is, I think she is probably more intelligent than me... However, what impresses me more about Kaylyn is her sheer maturity. You really can't teach maturity; sometimes, you just have to live through it. It's funny because she is much younger than me, yet she possesses a wealth of knowledge that she shares, which puts our situations into perspective.

I met with Kaylyn at a coffee shop recently, and we discussed the realities of growing up. It appeared that we were both mind-boggled by certain things, and I would offer my perspective on her worries, and she would do the same for me. Thus, my complaint was primarily about how difficult graduate school has been. It's been challenging socially and academically, where our day-to-day is not as exciting as one might think at this level of education. But from the outside looking in, it is almost impossible to ever figure this out without actually being in it. However, she put into perspective how this opportunity is a great one and that you are quite literally taking the place of someone else who most desperately wants it. Therefore, instead of complaining all the time, it's probably better to just appreciate the situation we are in and be grateful. For how simple this point of view is, I thought it was really helpful. I think many people look at the position I am in and expect great things from me. Thus, it is almost my duty to go through these next few years gracefully. We all face challenges all the time, but sometimes we forget how lucky we are to be in certain situations. It's really funny to hear someone younger than me give me advice, but I truly appreciated her words in helping me move forward.
