March was an especially busy time in my life as I was navigating through a particularly challenging academic semester. Life has slowed down quite a bit since the exciting start of my Ph.D., and I think this slower pace will be the new normal moving forward. However, March was the perfect time to reset my mind, coinciding with the end of the winter term here at UCLA. This meant that Spring break was right around the corner, and this year, I was planning an extravagant trip to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to visit both Dubai and Abu Dhabi. I have never been to such places in my life and have long wanted to visit them. Therefore, I was generally excited to be traveling once more and exploring what the world has to offer.

# Top ~~Three~~ Highlights of the Month

### 1. Dubai & Abu Dhabi

#### Day 1

This month, I was fortunate enough to travel to the UAE, where I visited Dubai and Abu Dhabi. This was my first time in the actual Middle East, and it was exciting to put on my adventure boots once again. Typically, when I visit a new country, I don't really make plans, but because the UAE was a more unfamiliar place, I ended up booking a full itinerary before my departure. Planning this about a month in advance, I scored a pretty sweet deal for around $800 USD for four nights in Dubai, including hotel and a full itinerary for most of those days. Lodging and tickets to attractions were all included, and I only really needed to pay for food while I was there.

So, to start the trip, I endured the terribly long flight, which lasted for 17 hours total. It got off to a terrible start because I had a layover in Toronto, but that initial flight from LA to Toronto was delayed to the point where I would have less than an hour before my connecting flight to Dubai. Since it was an international flight, I had to go through customs and security once again, which was pretty frustrating. However, all ended up being well as I buckled my seatbelt for the long 13-hour flight. I ended up sleeping horizontally for most of the flight because there was hardly anyone on the plane, but it turned out to be a grave mistake because when I landed, it was late evening, meaning it was soon to be night time.

Upon arrival, I decided to grab some food and visit the infamous Burj Khalifa, which was quite literally the only attraction I knew of in that country. I took an Uber to this area, and my driver greeted me and offered to drive me around that night. It was a relatively nice gesture, and they were able to take me to their favorite restaurant. After eating, I noticed that there were quite a few Indian people in Dubai. Little did I know, there are more Indians living in Dubai than actual Arab people. I spent the rest of the night at the Dubai Mall and Burj Khalifa, where I saw the mesmerizing building. The architecture was truly incredible, and I was excited for what was ahead. However, I must say that the weather was quite awful, as it was very humid, much like my time in Miami, Florida.

#### Day 2

Day 2 began with the actual tour of the city of Dubai, where I aimed to visit every "tourist" attraction possible. The schedule was jam-packed and very tiring, especially because I couldn't sleep, having slept throughout the plane ride prior to arriving. However, it was all good, and I was in good spirits for the coming day. Dubai is known for its wealth, and this country did not hold back when it came to showcasing it. We visited the King of Dubai's "house", the prince's house, which was very comparable to the Palace of Versailles in Paris. We then went to the man-made islands (Palm Jumeirah), synthetic islands where a lot of expensive real estate is located. My tour guide showed me around and mentioned that the richest man in India had just bought his son a property on this island which sold for 500 million Durham ($136,147,050 USD)! These houses weren't even that nice, in my opinion, but I guess who could say they live on an island...

After the island, the tour guide took me around to see some famous buildings and hotels in Dubai, including Atlantis and others. Rumor on the street was that Jackie Chan stayed in the Atlantis Presidential Suite nearly 10 years ago, where the room cost over 500k per night. Talk about a country with incredible wealth! After we drove around the city, we stopped by an attraction called the Dubai Frame, which is quite literally a giant 40-story building that looks like a photo frame. At the top of this frame, there is a nice view of "New Dubai". I thought it was cool to have but again it felt relatively unnecessary, in my opinion. In fact, a lot of things in this city felt this way, but their excuse for having all these nice things is the fact that they have money. Their solution to happiness is to build everything imaginable in this city to mimic a utopia. Unfortunately for me, I felt like this place was more of a dystopia because they were trying to force the existence of all these things that didn't really belong there (e.g., ski slopes). It really put into perspective how synthetic the city was because, at the end of the day, we were just really inside a metropolis next to a vast desert. You could really tell it was a desert too because the skies were red from the sandstorms.

After the Dubai Frame, we stopped by the Future Museum, where they predict what the future of the world will be like in 100 years (a lot of technology/AI), and then we made our way back to the Dubai Mall, where I had some free time. There, I ate a Turkish meal and then went up the infamous Burj Khalifa. It's actually really funny how many towers I have been up in the last 2 years alone because it feels like every major city has a giant tower towering over their city. Well, nothing quite compares to this one because the Burj Khalifa stands at 163 stories tall, well beyond any other tower in the world. My guide told me that the King of Dubai wanted to make sure that it was the tallest man-made structure in the world, so they just flat out beat any existing competition there was. The next tallest building is in Malaysia where the Merdeka 118 stands just 118 stories tall, nearly 45 stories shorter than the Burj Khalifa. Going up the Burj Khalifa was borderline underwhelming because, again, it put into perspective that we were in a big desert. The city, aside from its tall buildings, really had nothing around it. However, it was nice knowing that I was able to visit the tallest building in the world. Upon going down, my feet were incredibly swollen, so I finished the rest of my time there getting a foot massage. It was by far one of the most incredible experiences of my life.

To conclude the day, we went down to "Business Bay," where I would have dinner on a boat. There, I met the only other Asian family from Malaysia, and we shared dinner together. It was incredibly interesting to hear their point of view on what they thought America was like, and truth be told, it seemed like their perception of America was very skewed. The whole time they asked me about the guns, safety, and the presidential election, which made me feel like America gets terrible media coverage from other countries. After returning to the hotel, I was exhausted but had an early start at 3 AM the next morning.

#### Day 3



# One thing I learned this Month

### "Be Grateful"

This month, towards the end, I spoke with one of the friends I made over the quarter: Kaylyn Phan. She is an incredibly smart individual, graduating just like me in just three years. She studies computer science and is off to Meta after completing her degree this coming spring semester. We met in a computer science course and sat next to each other nearly the whole quarter and she was one of the few classmates that I got to know since my return to school. She works extremely hard and truth is, I think she is probably more intelligent than me... However, what impresses me more about Kaylyn is her sheer maturity. You really can't teach maturity; sometimes, you just have to live through it. It's funny because she is much younger than me, yet she possesses a wealth of knowledge that she shares, which puts our situations into perspective.

I met with Kaylyn at a coffee shop recently, and we discussed the realities of growing up. It appeared that we were both mind-boggled by certain things, and I would offer my perspective on her worries, and she would do the same for me. Thus, my complaint was primarily about how difficult graduate school has been. It's been challenging socially and academically, where our day-to-day is not as exciting as one might think at this level of education. But from the outside looking in, it is almost impossible to ever figure this out without actually being in it. However, she put into perspective how this opportunity is a great one and that you are quite literally taking the place of someone else who most desperately wants it. Therefore, instead of complaining all the time, it's probably better to just appreciate the situation we are in and be grateful. For how simple this point of view is, I thought it was really helpful. I think many people look at the position I am in and expect great things from me. Thus, it is almost my duty to go through these next few years gracefully. We all face challenges all the time, but sometimes we forget how lucky we are to be in certain situations. It's really funny to hear someone younger than me give me advice, but I truly appreciated her words in helping me move forward.
