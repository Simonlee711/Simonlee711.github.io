December 2023 came faster than I could have ever imagined. After having a poor start to the year, it really finished off amazingly. In fact, every day since the first day was far better than I could have ever imagined. This year was truly crazy but so beautiful. The number of strangers that became friends, the plethora of places I explored, and the multiple changes in the direction of my life made this year truly different and exciting. In fact, I will really miss the crazy adventures I had all year because it was truly like no other. However, as the year closes, it is time to reflect and set future goals for the incoming 2024. I really like December as it's a time to celebrate with family and friends, and that is exactly what I did to conclude the year.

# Top Three Highlights of the Month

### 1. Korea 

One of the first highlights of the month was finishing school and heading straight to Korea (and Japan). Actually, it turned out to be a minor mistake to leave so early because I had so much work to do, but nonetheless, it was very fun and exciting. I hadn't been to Korea in over six years, and it was going to be great to revisit the city again. When we landed, it was freezing as we had arrived in the coldest week of the year. I remember checking the weather app and seeing a high of 12 degrees Fahrenheit. So, even with six layers of clothes, I could never beat the cold...

One memorable moment from the trip was getting to spend some time with my cousin. After maturing and growing up, it was the first time that my siblings and I truly got to engage in meaningful conversation with our cousins. For so long, we found it very difficult to communicate with one another, but our cousins had learned English, and our sister had learned Korean, making it possible to communicate with one another. While it was brief, we shared good moments and had promised each other that in the future, we would move to New York City together, so that was something I was looking forward to.

Another highlight was just exploring all of Korea. Although it had only been six years since I had last visited, there were hardly any concrete memories of the orientation or the landmarks in Seoul. Therefore, we went to all types of places like Myeongdong, Itaewon, Dongdaemun, and much more. One of my favorite aspects of Korea is being able to eat their delicious food, which consisted of many spicy soups, seafood, rice cakes, and more. I'm not sure if I can say I ate everything I wanted to, but there were also so many brand-new foods that I had never tried before. Overall, Korea was a fantastic time, and I was very happy to be able to visit there, not just to see family but also to explore the city of Seoul and its food scene.
