December 2023 came faster than I could have ever imagined. After having a poor start to the year, it really finished off amazingly. In fact, every day since the first day was far better than I could have ever imagined. This year was truly crazy but so beautiful. The number of strangers that became friends, the plethora of places I explored, and the multiple changes in the direction of my life made this year truly different and exciting. In fact, I will really miss the crazy adventures I had all year because it was truly like no other. However, as the year closes, it is time to reflect and set future goals for the incoming 2024. I really like December as it's a time to celebrate with family and friends, and that is exactly what I did to conclude the year.

# Top Three Highlights of the Month

### 1. Korea 

One of the first highlights of the month was finishing school and heading straight to Korea (and Japan). Actually it turned out to be a minor mistake to leave so early because I had so much work to do still but nonetheless it was very fun and exciting. I hadn't been to Korea in over six years and it was going to be great to revisit the city again. When we landed it was freezing as we had arrived in the coldest week of the year. I remember checking the weather app and seeing a high of 12 degrees farenheight. So even with six layers of clothes I could never beat the cold...

One memormorable moment from the trip was to get to spend some time with my cousin. After maturing and growing up, it was the first time that my siblings and I truly got to engage in meaningful conversation with our cousins. For so long we found it very difficult to communicate with one another but our cousins had learned English, and our sister had learned Korean making it possible to communicate with one another. While it was brief we shared good moments and had promised each other that in the future we would be move to New York City together so that was something I was looking forward to.
