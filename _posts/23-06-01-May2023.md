In the month of May, as the days stretch longer and nature bursts forth in vibrant hues, the bittersweet art of saying goodbye takes center stage. It's a paradoxical act, laden with both the weight of endings and the promise of new beginnings. Bid farewell to a chapter of life, and you relinquish the comfort of familiarity, the shared laughter, and the countless memories etched into the tapestry of time. The ache of separation can be profound, like a melody cut short, leaving behind an echo of unfinished verses. Yet, amidst the sadness, there's an unexpected beauty. Goodbyes remind us of the depth of connections forged, of the heart's capacity to feel deeply. As we part ways, we are nudged to reflect on growth, to cherish the lessons learned and the laughter shared. Goodbyes, though often tinged with sorrow, paint the canvas of our lives with hues of resilience and hope, whispering that in every ending lies the seed of a new beginning.

But why? Just last month, we talked about how I formed a great group of friends at Harvard. So, why did I want to leave? Back in February, I mentioned getting my one and only Ph.D. acceptance. It was a surprising moment for me. Now, in May, I felt sure that my time working was almost over. To be honest, I wasn't really enjoying working yet. I'm only 21, and working full-time didn't feel right to me. The industry's expectations didn't match with what I had hoped for. During my time in Boston, I often found myself thinking about what the next several years of my life would be like. I wondered if the usual 9-5 routine was all there was. I felt stuck. Even though I was getting used to being an adult, I still felt a bit out of place with my friends from school. It was like I missed being in school and the special camaraderie of a university. The word "college" never felt significant to me because I think I missed out on the real experience due to Covid. While the introspection was helpful, it also made me realize that I missed out on what should have been some of the best years of my life (My last year was probably my one only amazing year of college <\3). Spending time with these wonderful people made me realize that I wanted that feeling of connection, but in a way that was true to me. So, I'm happy to share that I'll be going back to UCLA for my Ph.D. this fall.

With that said, I can admit that I don't really want to fully grow up just yet. There's more out there for me to explore before I settle into a long-term job. By going to graduate school again, I hope to find something that will always keep me curious. During my extended time in grad school, I'm searching for a career goal that will last a lifetime. Overall, I have no regrets about my time in Boston. It helped me grow and taught me important lessons that might prevent a midlife crisis later down the line. So, to the city of Boston, I'm truly thankful for letting me call it home, but it's time for me to move on. Once again, I leave this city knowing I've grown in many ways, and I hope my decision will lead me to exactly what I'm looking for when I return to the City of Stars, also known as Los Angeles.
