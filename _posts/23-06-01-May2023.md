In the month of May, as the days stretch longer and nature bursts forth in vibrant hues, the bittersweet art of saying goodbye takes center stage. It's a paradoxical act, laden with both the weight of endings and the promise of new beginnings. Bid farewell to a chapter of life, and you relinquish the comfort of familiarity, the shared laughter, and the countless memories etched into the tapestry of time. The ache of separation can be profound, like a melody cut short, leaving behind an echo of unfinished verses. Yet, amidst the sadness, there's an unexpected beauty. Goodbyes remind us of the depth of connections forged, of the heart's capacity to feel deeply. As we part ways, we are nudged to reflect on growth, to cherish the lessons learned and the laughter shared. Goodbyes, though often tinged with sorrow, paint the canvas of our lives with hues of resilience and hope, whispering that in every ending lies the seed of a new beginning.

But why? Just last month, we talked about how I formed a great group of friends at Harvard. So, why did I want to leave? Back in February, I mentioned getting my one and only Ph.D. acceptance. It was a surprising moment for me. Now, in May, I felt sure that my time working was almost over. To be honest, I wasn't really enjoying working yet. I'm only 21, and working full-time didn't feel right to me. The industry's expectations didn't match with what I had hoped for. During my time in Boston, I often found myself thinking about what the next several years of my life would be like. I wondered if the usual 9-5 routine was all there was. I felt stuck. Even though I was getting used to being an adult, I still felt a bit out of place with my friends from school. It was like I missed being in school and the special camaraderie of a university. The word "college" never felt significant to me because I think I missed out on the real experience due to Covid. While the introspection was helpful, it also made me realize that I missed out on what should have been some of the best years of my life (My last year was probably my one only amazing year of college <\3). Spending time with these wonderful people made me realize that I wanted that feeling of connection, but in a way that was true to me. So, I'm happy to share that I'll be going back to UCLA for my Ph.D. this fall.

With that said, I can admit that I don't really want to fully grow up just yet. There's more out there for me to explore before I settle into a long-term job. By going to graduate school again, I hope to find something that will always keep me curious. During my extended time in grad school, I'm searching for a career goal that will last a lifetime. Overall, I have no regrets about my time in Boston. It helped me grow and taught me important lessons that might prevent a midlife crisis later down the line. So, to the city of Boston, I'm truly thankful for letting me call it home, but it's time for me to move on. Once again, I leave this city knowing I've grown in many ways, and I hope my decision will lead me to exactly what I'm looking for when I return to the City of Stars, also known as Los Angeles.

# Top Three Highlights of the Month

### 1. Saying Goodbye

Saying goodbye is a bittersweet act that carries both positive and negative implications. On the positive side, bidding farewell can be a powerful catalyst for personal growth and new beginnings. When we say goodbye, we often step out of our comfort zones and embrace change, opening doors to fresh experiences and opportunities. It encourages us to confront challenges head-on, fostering resilience and adaptability. Moreover, saying goodbye allows us to create lasting memories and connections. The act of parting can deepen our appreciation for the moments and relationships we've cherished, leaving us with a sense of nostalgia and gratitude. Ultimately, saying goodbye serves as a reminder that life is a dynamic journey, and each farewell marks a chapter's end while paving the way for the next exciting adventure.

However, bidding adieu also carries its downsides. One of the notable drawbacks is the emotional toll it can take on individuals. Saying goodbye often entails leaving behind loved ones, whether they are friends, family, or colleagues. The ensuing sense of loss and separation can lead to feelings of sadness, loneliness, and even anxiety. Additionally, goodbyes can create a sense of uncertainty about the future, especially when departing from a familiar environment. The prospect of entering the unknown can be daunting and unsettling, evoking apprehension and doubt. Furthermore, goodbyes can sometimes trigger a sense of nostalgia, causing us to dwell on past experiences and miss the moments we've left behind. In this way, while goodbyes can signify growth and change, they can also evoke challenging emotions and uncertainties.

But out of my own happiness, I don't think this was where I am supposed to be now. I am grateful for the opportunties life has given me, but it just didn't feel right. And the feelings I felt this month seem so hypocritical knowing that the one thing I wanted most was stability in the year 2023. Since I graduated college, and throughout my journies across both Europe and the East coast, I realized that there was constant change constantly occuring in my life. I openly admit that I never give myself stability possibly out of the fear of getting to comfortable. But by signing my life for the next 5 or so years in LA, I think I will first off find a place to call home, and will finally get this stability that I have sought after for so long. 

I think it helped me make this decision knowing that Harvards semester was also coming to a close. To all the friends I made at Harvard - Camilla, Melanie, Anna, Van, Giselle, Carlo, & Jess- I am really grateful. To say I have a small community of friends at Harvard was sort of the most random side quest I have ever been on. But I was happy to be an honorary Harvard member in the past two months I had spent with all of you. The personal background stories, the intellect, and the aspirations were truly one of a kind, and it makes sense that all of you are at the Number 1 university in the world. Goodbyes are really hard, but its a feeling I have gotten used to at this point. Having to constantly say goodbye has felt numb in a way, but I will always cherish the memories that we shared together. But on the otherside, I am happy knowing that I can continue to expand my lucrative network and always have a group of friends I can go to on the East coast. 

This month two goodbyes hit hard though. Both Jess and Lauren were two of my great friends in Boston that I spent significant time with. I shared a lot of my vulnerable thoughts with the each of them, and how my life doesn't feel real. While life has been fun constantly exploring new places and meeting new people, I think I hardly mention how hard it is to leave good friends in your life. Though these relationships do last a lifetime, proximity plays such a big role in maintaining strong relationships. But the reason these two hit a little harder was because we all shed a tear in our goodbyes to one another. Jess accepted me for who I was in a time of confusion and I really appreciated her kindness and affirmations she always shared with me. And I will miss Lauren just as much because she was my first friend from Boston. Though we were at drastically different levels in life, she taught me and brought me many opportunities to embrace being young and having fun. From going out to AYCE Sushi, to the many club nights we had around Boston, I was going to miss these two a lot. 

However goodbyes like stated in the intro, mark the beginning of brand new chapters. It isn't always that we get fresh restarts in life, but I had already gotten two in the span of one year. To say I am excited is an understatement. Being back in LA is an experience like no other. Though I don't see it as a forever home, it was going to be home for the forseeable future. It's such a funny word for me, because I don't really know what home means to me. Whether its a place or the people, I guess there are still many things to discover in my next journey. Regardless, I look forward to this last pit stop of education. I have plenty of goals set already on a personal and academic level and I am truly blessed to get this opportunity. So I'm going to leave it on a highnote and say bring it on again LA!

### 2. Julie & Appreciating Yourself

The second highlight of the month revolved around forming a new friendship in Boston – Julie Wang. Although our acquaintance was relatively short, Julie imparted a valuable lesson in the month of May. Before delving into that, let's set the stage by introducing her. Julie, a student at Tufts University, was pursuing a double major in CS and Mathematics and had an exceptional pride in her home state of New Jersey. (I've never met someone so passionate about New Jersey!) As usual, our connection was made through Hinge, a fact that won't come as a surprise given my knack for unconventional friend-making. Given the timing – her semester ending and my Boston stint winding down – we commenced and concluded our friendship. Julie's vibrant character made interacting with her truly enjoyable. Despite her boundless energy, she also possessed a gentle demeanor, making her a great listener and a delightful presence overall.

One of my cherished anecdotes involving Julie traces back to our initial meeting. On a rather late night, we rendezvoused at Tufts and decided to explore Davis Square, renowned for its culinary offerings. There was, however, a major hitch – it was around 10:30 pm, and most eateries were shuttered. In the heart of the square, we found a cozy spot to converse, but what stood out was our plan to have ice cream afterwards. This seemingly ordinary plan took an extraordinary twist due to Julie's lactose intolerance. Nonetheless, she shared her mission of training her digestive system to handle dairy, even against the odds. This tale epitomizes her ambitious spirit, a trait that colored our time together with boundless fun.

Yet, what resonated with me the most about Julie was her outlook on life. I can't recall exactly how the conversation unfolded, but her light-heartedness was coupled with profound insights. She eloquently taught me the significance of self-appreciation, regardless of external circumstances. This notion struck a chord, as I realized that I hadn't truly valued myself despite my reflective nature. Julie recounted her own journey of embracing her achievements, even in a field she didn't entirely love. Her perspective was eye-opening, as she acknowledged her accomplishments within a predominantly male-dominated field and the privilege of her education. These conversations with Julie were a poignant reminder to appreciate oneself amidst life's challenges.

Julie embodied the essence of a well-rounded life. Like my own final year of college, she effortlessly blended hard work with ample fun, a balance that was inspiring. Her ability to sustain this equilibrium throughout her college years left a lasting impression on me. This brings us to the question of why striking this balance is crucial. Balancing hard work and fun is the key to a fulfilling life. Diligent work empowers us to chase our dreams, enhance our skills, and secure our future. It builds resilience and self-confidence, offering a sense of purpose and achievement.

Nonetheless, excessive focus on work can lead to burnout and diminish our overall well-being. This is where the importance of having fun comes into play. Engaging in activities we enjoy, spending time with loved ones, and indulging in hobbies provide a vital release from stress and reinvigorate our spirits. These moments of leisure allow us to explore new interests, ignite our creativity, and bask in the simple joys of life. Finding this equilibrium can be a lifelong pursuit, but the lessons from Julie's perspective – appreciating oneself and cherishing the simple pleasures – serve as valuable guideposts on this journey.
