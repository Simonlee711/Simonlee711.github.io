# Top Three Highlights of the Month

### 1. Thanksgiving

### 2. Josh & I's excursion to Prague

### 3. Africa

Africa has always been a dream destination for me. Ever since my high school days, the rich history and exotic landscapes of Africa have held a strong allure. Therefore, for this week's post, I wanted to share my first-time experience exploring various areas of Morocco. I chose to travel to Morocco during the off-season, ensuring favorable weather conditions and great value for the trip. To make it easier to digest, I'll be breaking up this post into different parts.

One of the initial misconceptions I held about Morocco and Africa at large was the notion that everywhere would resemble a "safari" environment. This, of course, turned out to be far from the truth, as certain animals simply cannot thrive in the harsh conditions of the Sahara Desert. As I arrived in Marrakech, a bustling metropolis in the western part of Morocco, I was struck by the prevalence of Islamic culture throughout northern Africa. In fact, if I were to map it out, I might even extend the region as an appendage of the Middle East. Thus, upon reaching the city, I quickly realized that encounters with elephants and lions would have to wait for another journey. Nonetheless, there was an abundance of sights to explore, and my adventure begins with about a dozen complete strangers embarking on a journey eastward across the rustic Atlas Mountains, en route to the Sahara Desert.

#### Day 1

One of our initial significant stops was Ait Zineb, renowned for its captivating landscape and ancient tribal structures that have graced the screens of multiple movies. Blockbusters such as The Mummy, National Treasure, and Indiana Jones have all chosen Ait Zineb as their backdrop, radiating Tatooine Vibes reminiscent of Star Wars. Amidst the captivating scenery, an astonishing revelation was brought to light during this trip: the harmonious coexistence of Christians, Jews, and Muslims across most of Morocco. Contrary to the often tumultuous stories we encounter in the media concerning religious tensions in places like Israel, our local guide imparted to us the centuries of peaceful cohabitation among these faiths. The Timbuktu tribe (a name that might ring a bell from AP World History!) that once inhabited Ait Zineb exemplified this harmony, sharing a civil existence with the Jewish community. Remarkably, they communicated through a written language utilizing Macha spice.

Intriguing layers of history emerged as I delved deeper into the culture, notably their reverence for spices and the intricate connections between self-care and artistry. In Africa, a profound aversion to chemicals fuels the inclination to embrace nature's bounties in their daily lives. For instance, the rejection of sunblock due to apprehensions about "foreign chemicals" influencing health is a common practice. Instead, the Moroccan people employ Saffron, often known as a culinary spice. In a twist of knowledge, I learned that Saffron doubles as a natural sunblock, especially apt for the scorching Moroccan sun. This insight lends meaning to the moniker "Blue Men," attributed to the Saharan caravan traders due to their association with Saffron, revealing yet another layer of Morocco's rich narrative.

Their resourcefulness with natural spices extends even to their artistic endeavors. Amidst a world of paints, crayons, and art supplies often laden with copious chemicals, the indigenous people of Morocco uphold their steadfast commitment to natural practices. In a departure from contemporary methods, they adopt a technique akin to watercoloring, wherein a brush dipped in water is employed to blend natural spices, serving as their unique "paint." Among the unexpected components employed as "paints," Macha stands out. This intriguing ingredient allows them to extract hues reminiscent of the desert's palette. Once the creative process is complete, the artwork is subjected to an open flame, which imparts a robust permanence that resists smudging, a stark departure from the vulnerability of conventional paints and crayons when exposed to water. Every stroke in their artistry embodies a genuine connection to the earth, reflecting their holistic commitment to all things natural.

Covering a total distance of approximately 300 km over the course of four days, our guide meticulously divided the journey into several manageable segments. What truly astonished me was the journey's ability to maintain a sense of brevity, a credit to the well-thought-out breaks that punctuated our passage. After a full day's voyage, we arrived in the modest enclave of Tinghir. Amidst its modesty, this small "town" became a meeting point where camaraderie and connections blossomed amongst fellow travelers embarking on the same voyage. As we readied ourselves for the days ahead, bonds of friendship formed, weaving our stories together. In this shared moment, I found myself in the company of Carol and Thomas from Singapore, Selena from Italy, Gareth from Ireland, and Pedro from Spain. Evidently, their life experiences surpassed my own, with a running joke that Carol and Thomas exceeded my age by more than threefold. Yet, much like my broader European experience, engaging with these individuals enriched my journey profoundly. Amidst conversations, the theme of travel's unparalleled value emerged, especially for young adventurers. Toasting to our newfound camaraderie, we enjoyed glasses of wine alongside Tajine, a local dish rooted in Muslim culture, and in doing so, embraced both the flavors of Morocco and the shared bond of our journey.
 
# Day 2 & 3
 
Day 2 proved to be the most densely packed of our journey, as it marked our long-awaited arrival at the Sahara Desert. However, before we embarked on our desert adventure, we made a notable stop at the quaint tribal town of Toudgha El Oulia. Nestled within a canyon, this town offered a unique setting. While our exploration of the canyon's depths was limited, we were fortunate enough to catch a glimpse of the captivating scenery that lay within its walls.

A humorous anecdote from my time in the canyon revolves around the thriving barter culture that has persisted throughout Moroccan history. It's safe to say that in Morocco, fixed prices are a rarity. Thus, mastering the art of negotiation became a skill I honed during my time in the country. Admittedly, there were some missteps along the way, and this story recounts one of those instances. In Toudgha El Oulia, I was determined to acquire a traditional jacket I had spotted. Engaging with a local vendor, we began our negotiations. However, despite our efforts, we failed to reach an agreement, and the vendor proposed that I take the jacket and continue the negotiations on my return. Here's where things took an unexpected turn. On our way back, without any further negotiations, the vendor promptly charged me 400 Dahmers (USD 40). Not wanting to hold up the group, I found myself caught off guard, and he emerged victorious without any more negotiation—an inadvertent win for the local vendor at the expense of the tourist.

During our journey, we also made a stop at a rug store, where we encountered a vendor responsible for crafting rugs for neighboring towns across Morocco. Handmade from a range of materials including camel fur and wool, these rugs were a testament to local craftsmanship. As the visit concluded, the vendor inquired if anyone was interested in making a purchase. Having learned my lesson earlier in the day, I declined politely. However, Gareth and Selena were subjected to persistent sales tactics and ended up buying tiny rugs at staggering prices of 780 Dahmers and 1140 Dahmers respectively. Such experiences highlight the challenges of being a tourist in these regions, where navigating the commercial landscape often presents unexpected twists.

While this day held further adventures, I want to delve into our main excursion to Merzouga, nestled within the Saharan Desert. Every aspect of this journey lived up to its anticipation because Merzouga was nothing short of spectacular. Arriving in the late afternoon, we were set to journey to our desert campsite by camel. While I had previously encountered deserts in Arizona and California, there was a distinct and captivating beauty to be found in the Sahara.

Our camel expedition extended for approximately two hours into the heart of the Sahara, and I can genuinely say that every single second was worth it. While my camel displayed a bit of unpredictable behavior—perhaps due to its pregnancy—the experience was nevertheless one of the most serene and delightful moments of my life. There's an inexplicable beauty that unfurls when you find yourself amidst vast expanses, enveloped in silence that stretches far beyond the horizon. As we journeyed deeper into the desert, we eventually paused, taking a brief respite to witness the sun's descent over Erg Chebbi, a renowned route within the Sahara.

The camera lens managed to capture hues that seemed almost surreal, painting a canvas of colors that defied ordinary imagination. The interplay of contrasting shades was marvelously preserved by my iPhone, showcasing nature's artistry at its finest. Take a moment to gaze upon these breathtaking snapshots:

We were also fortunate enough to engage in sandboarding, an exhilarating activity that held its own kind of awe. Imagine snowboarding, but on the rippling sandy dunes of the Sahara. While there were no straps to secure your board, the natural friction between the board and the soft sand surface allowed for a perfectly controlled descent. What amazed me even more was the absence of wildlife in the Sahara. While the desert does harbor potentially lethal creatures like scorpions and snakes, the ever-fluctuating climate seemed to deter much of the usual wildlife. This meant that within the expanse of the desert, it was just us, free to explore without the typical concerns of encountering dangerous animals.

As the night drew to a close, one moment remained etched in my memory—the awe-inspiring act of stargazing in the midst of nowhere. In a place untouched by light pollution and human distractions, the sight was nothing short of spectacular. I used to view those images of the Milky Way as mere artistic embellishments, assuming they were digitally altered. But out there, amidst the solitude of the desert, I was met with a true cosmic canvas. Although the biting cold nearly reached freezing temperatures, the experience was indelible. Stargazing proved to be an incredible activity, showcasing the universe's grandeur. And, being a city enthusiast, I realized that such sights are reserved for moments far removed from urban life. The sky was so magnificent that even my iPhone's camera managed to capture a glimpse, a feat seemingly impossible under normal conditions.
