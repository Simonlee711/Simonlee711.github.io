# Introduction

Welcome to Simon's monthly newsletter. I am pleased to introduce this new series as a replacement for my previous blog, which I initiated upon launching this website. The decision to transition to a monthly newsletter stemmed from my inability to maintain the weekly schedule I had initially committed to at the beginning of the new year. Balancing life's demands and occasionally encountering writer's block made it increasingly challenging to consistently deliver the meaningful content I aspire to offer my valued audience. Consequently, we have opted to revamp the format and will now be sharing monthly updates in the form of newsletters, encompassing updates about my life and the year's progress. Going forward, the newsletter will follow a structured approach, encompassing the following sections: 1. General Updates, 2. Top Three Highlights of the Month, 3. Lessons Learned this Month, 4. Where is my head at?, and finally, 5. A Quote of the month. Additionally, there may be occasional special editions of the blog that deviate from this monthly framework, addressing specific topics or events. It is my intention to release these brand new monthly newsletters on the first day of each month, and "subscribers" will receive a copy via email. If you are not on the email-list, the newsletter will also be available on this website under the blogs tab. So sit back, relax, and I can't wait to tell you about my month.

# General Updates

Once again, the winds of change have swept me across the country after spending the past six-months on a journey in Switzerland. Change has been a constant companion throughout the past year, bringing both opportunities and challenges. In this blog post, I'll share my excitement about starting anew in Boston, a city that holds great promise. From personal growth to scientific wonders and legendary sports teams, there's a lot to look forward to in this premier East Coast destination. Join me as I embark on this new chapter, leaving behind a lackluster European experience and embracing the vibrant possibilities that await.

Boston, a city where brilliant minds converge, has always fascinated me. It has served as a breeding ground for visionaries like Mark Zuckerberg, Neil DeGrasse Tyson, and Gilbert Strang, who honed their skills and made significant contributions during their time here. Its world-renowned universities, such as Harvard and MIT, attract exceptional talent and create an intellectually stimulating environment. Similarly, Boston's sports legacy is awe-inspiring, with legends like Tom Brady, the New England Patriots, the Boston Celtics, and the Boston Bruins etching their names in history. This city has witnessed remarkable sports moments, hosting iconic athletes like LeBron James, Stephen Curry, and Kobe Bryant on their quest for championship glory. While I don't expect to become a legend overnight, I'm eager to learn from this city's vibrant culture and use those experiences to propel my own career.

My decision to move to Boston was driven by the opportunity to embark on my first professional journey in the industry. I consider myself fortunate to have found a position at Celsius Therapeutics, a biotech company focused on precision medicine. As a data scientist, I'll contribute to their groundbreaking efforts in various capacities. The location of the company, nestled in the heart of Kendall Square, further amplifies the excitement. Kendall Square is a bustling hub known for its thriving tech and biotech ecosystem â€” a Palo Alto of the Silicon Valley for those familiar with California. With prestigious institutions like MIT and Harvard in close proximity, our office becomes a dynamic space brimming with innovation. In the weeks and months ahead, I eagerly anticipate the fresh challenges and opportunities that await me in this thriving city.

As I embark on my Bostonian adventure, I reflect on the inevitability of change and the boundless possibilities it brings. Leaving behind Switzerland and a lackluster European experience, I am eager to embrace the energy and vibrancy of Boston. This city's intellectual capital, legendary sports legacy, and thriving biotech industry offer a wealth of inspiration and opportunity. With my new role, I'm ready to dive headfirst into this fresh start.  With my fresh start in Boston, I anticipate a plethora of new experiences, places to explore, people to meet, and memories to create. From strolling through historic neighborhoods and embracing the vibrant art scene to indulging in local culinary delights and immersing myself in the rich cultural tapestry, Boston offers a multitude of avenues for personal growth. Each day presents an opportunity to learn, connect, and build a life that combines professional success with a sense of fulfillment. I look forward to the foreseeable future in this captivating city, eagerly anticipating the adventures that lie ahead.
