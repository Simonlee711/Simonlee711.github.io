**This week's blog is pretty lengthy as it is all about travel and the trips I went on...**

# General Updates

March was a big travel month for me. I became so fed up with the weather in Boston that I decided to leave every chance I got. So typically I began traveling on Fridays due to a lack of meetings at work and would return by Monday. In my short three months in Boston, I have come to appreciate the fabulous weather that was in California all along. Though Boston is on the more extreme side, I was certain that wherever I choose to call my long term home one day, it definitely would not be anywhere this remotely cold. Talking with my co-workers, they tell me things don't turn around until early May so looking forward to the proceeding months out here in New England. 

# Top Three Highlights of the Month

### 1. California Roadtrip

Recently, I have come to realize that friendship is one of the most valuable things in my life. A good friend can provide support, motivation, and simply be someone to talk to. It is a deep-rooted treasure that I hold dearly. Many aspects of my life have been influenced by the people I surround myself with, and they are a significant factor in my current accomplishments. With that being said, I would like to provide a brief overview of the reasons behind my trip and what it has meant to me.

During the past summer, I had the pleasure of meeting Osagie Aimiuwu, who quickly became one of my close friends from the time spent together at UCLA. He happened to be my next-door neighbor, and we developed a strong bond that continued beyond that summer. I greatly admire his sense of humor and his unabashed attitude. It was Osagie who came up with the idea of a road trip to California, and given that I grew up and attended college in California, it felt only right to show him around. Our planned trip involved traveling along the California coast, visiting five major cities along the way: San Francisco, Santa Cruz, Santa Barbara, Los Angeles, and San Diego. While all these cities are located near the ocean, each offers a distinct "Californian" experience. The success of this trip relied on the fact that I had close contacts in these five cities who were kind enough to host us during our journey. And so, the two of us embarked on what turned out to be a highly eventful week of travel.

#### Day 1: San Francisco

San Francisco is a place I have called home for quite some time. It's the city where I grew up and became familiar with every nook and cranny. The plan for that day was to show my friend around SF, pick up my other friend Philippa Steinburg, and later have dinner with my family before spending the night in Berkeley. However, as is often the case, things don't always go as planned, and I quickly realized that this trip would encounter some unexpected changes.

The first challenge we faced was with our rental car. Despite booking a Sports Utility Vehicle (SUV) months in advance, when we arrived to pick it up, we were handed a 2019 Toyota Corolla Sedan instead. This immediately shattered my dream of cruising with the windows down under the warm California sun. To make matters worse, California had been experiencing an Atmospheric River for months, which resulted in a series of intense storms throughout the state. It was such an unusual weather phenomenon that even Los Angeles had witnessed snow for the first time since 2007. Despite the unfavorable weather and our less-than-ideal vehicle situation, I was determined not to let these circumstances dampen our spirits. This trip was not only about showing Osagie around California but also about reconnecting with familiar faces and places.

After picking up Osagie from SFO airport, we headed to Sausalito, a charming town located across the Golden Gate Bridge. The drive to Sausalito brought back fond memories of biking with my father and brother from the Embarcadero district to this picturesque town, where we would reward ourselves with a delicious ice cream treat. Lost in my reminiscing, Osagie informed me that he had friends in Sausalito whom we would surprise. After meeting up with his friends and enjoying a nice lunch together, we continued our journey south, where we took the time to admire the Golden Gate Bridge, San Francisco's most iconic landmark. Despite the gloomy weather throughout the day, I distinctly remember it being unexpectedly hot and sunny as we walked across the bridge. Perhaps it was a foreshadowing of better weather to come in the following days, but as I soon discovered, my assumption was dead wrong.

{% include figure image_path="/images/rt/1.JPG" alt="this is a placeholder image" caption="Osagie & I @ Golden Gate Bridge!" %}

After our visit to the Golden Gate Bridge, we leisurely made our way to my family's home, passing by Ghirardelli Square, Pier 39, and Embarcadero before finally reaching Berkeley, where we were going to meet up with our first friend of the trip, Philippa Steinburg. Philippa and I had also met during the summer I spent in LA, and our shared love for skating brought us together. They are currently attending UC Berkeley and are in their senior year. As a fun fact, during my trip out of Europe, my last stop was in Hamburg, Germany, where I stayed with Philippa and their parents for three days before moving to Boston. Therefore, they are one of my good friends, and I was delighted to bring Osagie and introduce them to my family over dinner.

When we arrived at my parents' house in Walnut Creek, we treated our guests to a traditional Korean-style dinner, a cuisine they might not experience regularly. However, what made it interesting was that both Philippa and Osagie had dietary restrictions. Osagie disliked seafood, and Philippa followed a vegan diet. These ingredients are commonly found in Korean dishes, but that didn't stop my mother from getting creative with the menu. She served Inari Sushi, Kim-pap, and many other traditional dishes, accommodating their dietary needs. We had a fantastic dinner, sharing laughter and stories with my friends and family. It was also the first time my parents had the opportunity to meet my friends outside of my high school circle. It was a wonderful experience to bring together my family and friends before embarking on our real journey the next day.

As we bid farewell to my family, we continued on to Berkeley, where we would spend the night with Philippa. On our way, we took Fish Ranch Road, a winding path through the hills of Berkeley and Oakland. The dense fog limited our visibility to only three feet, but eventually, we arrived at Lawrence Hall of Science, where we were greeted with an incredible view of the bay. We concluded our day by strolling around UC Berkeley's beautiful campus, indulging in frozen yogurt from Yogurt Park, and catching up while the light rain slowly soaked our clothes.

#### Day 2: Santa Cruz

On Day 2 of our road trip, we made a brief stop in Santa Cruz. I had spent some time in Santa Cruz as an adult and had formed good friendships during my short stay there. Coincidentally, it was a holiday—March 14, also known as Pi Day—which called for a celebration. To mark the occasion, I picked up an apple pie from a local bakery where I ran into my friend, Alex Pavy. Alex had a significant impact on my life, as she encouraged me to become the person I had always dreamed of being. Her influence played a crucial role in shaping who I am today.

After meeting up with Alex, we headed to Woodstock's Pizza for lunch to celebrate Pi Day. We met with my applied mathematics friends—Adam, Adrian, Joey, and Brad—and enjoyed our pizza, pie, and brews together. It was wonderful to reconnect with them after nearly a year apart and hear about their plans for the future as they were nearing the end of their undergraduate studies.

{% include figure image_path="/images/rt/3.JPG" alt="this is a placeholder image" caption="(left to right) Adam, Joey, Adrian, Brad, Osagie & I enjoying Pi Day. My dearest applied mathematics friends during college." %}

Following our Pi Day celebration, Osagie and I took a break from our food comas and relaxed on the city's beach. Santa Cruz, California, is a coastal paradise that seamlessly combines natural beauty, a laid-back atmosphere, and a vibrant community. Nestled along the picturesque Monterey Bay, Santa Cruz offers stunning beaches, towering redwood forests, and a thriving surf culture. It is a haven for outdoor enthusiasts and nature lovers, with renowned surf spots such as Steamer Lane and Pleasure Point attracting surfers of all skill levels.

The charm of Santa Cruz extends beyond its natural wonders. The downtown area is a bustling hub with eclectic shops, local boutiques, and a wide array of delicious eateries. This unique blend of natural beauty, outdoor adventures, and vibrant culture makes Santa Cruz a must-visit destination on California's Central Coast. It was definitely worth showcasing during our road trip.

In the final part of the day, I met up with some old high school friends— Mateo Etcheveste, Ulises J. Yepez, and Kevin Hue. The five of us went to Hulas Hawaiian & Tiki Bar, where we caught up before diving into a game of poker. While Osagie was new to playing with real money on the line, the rest of us were low-key gamblers. We had a buy-in of $15, and the stakes were raised by Kevin's unpredictable playing style. He would push all his chips to the table, making it risky to call his bluffs. Unfortunately, I fell victim to one of his bluffs and quickly lost all my money. However, by the end of the night, Osagie had a winning streak and managed to beat Uli, Kevin, and me, making a profit of $75. It was quite the beginners' luck, but also a well-played match. Osagie later used his $75 profit to fund his lunches for the rest of the week.

#### Day 3: Santa Barbara

Santa Barbara was our next stop and it would be our second-longest drive of the whole trip lasting roughly five hours south. My original intention was to take Highway 1 which is the pacific coast highway down from Santa Cruz to San Luis Obispo but due to the atmospheric river, a part of the road has sunk in the ocean... However, in exchange, taking this route probably would have extended our drive by an hour so it was maybe for the better since this trip was jam-packed with stuff to do. The drive down was not very exciting since a lot of California is just valleys and farmland. California's landscape can be truly incredible due to the vast differences you witness by entering rural California. Upon reaching Santa Barbara we met up with Jaime Gomez who we would get dinner and stay the night with. I met Jaime Gomez who was in the fraternity during my freshman year of college. Jaime always sort of felt like the big brother of the group, always watching over people and taking care of them. To my anime watchers, you could almost compare him to a Reiner Braun from Attack on Titan before he goes crazy. Jaime just had a very easygoing personality and was among one of the few people I had high respect for in general. Unfortunately, after my second year of college ended, Jaime had transferred out which is the reason we could stay with him at UC Santa Barbara. Getting to catch up with him was great as he was in the midst of training (and now completed) for the LA Marathon while also telling me about his ambitions to start a business post-graduation. I have a strong belief that he will do this due to his personality, work ethic & accent! All jokes aside, it was wonderful to get to see him. We ended up going to a Mexican restaurant together and instead of enjoying the Santa Barbara sun, we experienced some extreme wind chills that made dinner uncomfortably cold.

{% include figure image_path="/images/rt/6.JPG" alt="this is a placeholder image" caption="Jaime & I enjoying dinner at Santa Barbara" %}

After dinner we let Jaime catch up on some work and we met with my friend Camille where we would later on go do some line dancing. Camille and I met last year at UCSB when I did a similar trip with Adam up to Santa Barbara. During that time Adam and Camille's friend strangely disappeared (lol), which sort of left her and I alone for some time. So during that time, we got to know each other as we were stargazing on the beach together. She knew me right before I would go on to this crazy gap year, and I remember telling her then that I was looking forward to graduating and telling her my plans of wanting to live a life that I remembered. Though we only knew each other from that weekend, we kept in touch a lot and I consider her one of my good friends. She told me that she plans to wrap up her degree from UCSB in data sciences and begin working at PwC where she will temporarily work before chasing her true ambition to teach.

{% include figure image_path="/images/rt/7.JPG" alt="this is a placeholder image" caption="Camille & I post-line-dancing" %}

Once we met up with Camille, we quickly learned two line dances, "Shivers" and "Good Times," before heading to a western bar where we would be immediately thrown into the mix. My experiences with line dancing go all the way back to middle school, where I remember doing grapevines and jazz steps. Unfortunately, I was socially exhausted by then, so I wasn't in the mood for dancing. However, Osagie seemed to really enjoy it and continued line dancing later in the trip.

At the bar, they also had a mechanical bull, which had long been on my going-out bucket list. Both Osagie and I rode the bull, but we were violently flung off. While I didn't groove on the dance floor that night, I must say that the line dancing culture looked fun for those who knew the dances. We ended our night once again with Jaime and headed to a mini karaoke bar. Surprisingly, considering it was a week right before finals, there were more people than expected. Jaime and I had no intentions of singing, but we encouraged Osagie to sign up since we were in the presence of an Acapella star. While Jaime and I enjoyed our brews, Osagie waited in the queue, only to be cut off right before the bright lights shone on him. Nevertheless, it wasn't all bad because Jaime shared some entertaining college stories that had Osagie and me laughing uncontrollably. Santa Barbara is always a must-visit for me, and it was great to see some old friends once again.

#### Day 4: Los Angeles

At last, we were on our way to Los Angeles, entering familiar grounds that held special significance for both of us. Having spent significant time in the city, we were particularly excited to reunite with some old friends. Our journey from Santa Barbara took us down Highway 1, allowing us to pass by the iconic California landmark of Malibu. However, as we arrived, the cloudy weather gave the city a somewhat distorted appearance. It was a rarity to see Los Angeles with bad weather, and it felt strange and unfamiliar.

Our plans for the day were to meet up with my old roommate from the summer, Saiyang Liu. Saiyang held a special place in my heart because we complemented each other in many ways. Initially, I didn't think we would be compatible due to our contrasting personalities. However, as the summer progressed, we found that we filled each other's deficiencies. My wild and carefree nature was grounded by spending time with Saiyang, and in turn, I saw him blossom and grow as a person. He was reserved, preferred doing things alone, and tended to be pessimistic. Our time together helped him break out of his shell. It was a rewarding experience to witness his gradual transformation. Though I felt guilty about frequently inviting everyone to our room over the summer, I saw Saiyang gradually joining us, which brought me joy. Since then, he has made friends in his classes and has been more adventurous, going on small weekend trips with his newfound friends.

Before meeting up with Saiyang, I had told Osagie that during our lunch with him, I promised we would hear him say "I feel terrible..." because he used to utter that phrase nearly every day in various contexts. To my surprise, not once during lunch did he utter those words. It made me happy to see how much he has grown and changed in the eight months since the summer ended. The three of us had lunch at BCD Tofu, my favorite Korean restaurant, where I convinced Osagie to try some tofu. I believe he took a small nibble, but I cannot confirm it. This restaurant specializes in soft tofu soup (Soondubu), and Saiyang and I both enjoyed it when I took him there last summer. It was a joy to see Saiyang doing well, and I am eagerly looking forward to returning to Los Angeles soon.

{% include figure image_path="/images/rt/10.JPG" alt="this is a placeholder image" caption="Saiyang & Osagie @ BCD Tofu" %}

After concluding our previous activities, we proceeded to El Segundo, where we were set to meet my good friend, Ben Au. Ben graciously hosted us for three nights and truly went above and beyond as a super host. In addition to providing accommodations, he took us on a tour of the city, shared fascinating facts, and showed us all the local hotspots. He made his hometown feel incredibly cool, and the overall experience was fantastic.

I briefly mentioned my relationship with Ben in last week's blog post, but allow me to delve deeper. Ben and I first crossed paths during our freshman year in the fraternity, but he made the decision to drop out of school two quarters later. Similar to the dynamic between Saiyang and me, Ben played a comparable role, albeit in reverse. Back then, I was the Saiyang, while Ben assumed the role that I would later embrace. As a freshman, I was drastically different from the person I am today, and I truly needed someone like Ben who encouraged me to seize the present and enjoy life to the fullest. I was quite sheltered, and he exposed me to both the ups and downs that life had to offer. When Ben departed, I realized that there was a void that couldn't be filled. Unfortunately, this realization came too late, as I failed to show sufficient appreciation for his presence during our time together. However, I was thrilled to witness the positive changes in his life following his departure from school.

Among his numerous impressive endeavors, Ben started his own surfboarding company called *Hyperion Surfboards* and collaborated on a clothing line called *Improper Etiquette*. I was proud to be one of his earliest supporters, but I was even more thrilled to witness his remarkable progress. Our friendship dynamic was such that he served as the older brother figure, excelling in social situations, while I dominated academically. I hope this illustrates why we were so beneficial to one another. Presently, he continues to manage these two ventures, while also working at a local bar called Richmond, and pursuing his degree in communications at Cal State, Long Beach.

Upon our arrival at Ben's place, we were pleasantly surprised to find that he wasn't there, but he had made sure we had everything we needed to make ourselves at home. This moment perfectly encapsulated Ben's easygoing nature and his "I run the city" mentality, which was a positive attribute. That day, Osagie had made arrangements to meet a friend from Nigeria, so the three of us went our separate ways for the evening. Ben and I caught up at a bar in Manhattan Beach, where we were joined by his current housemate, Cierra. It was a refreshing and enjoyable experience to have a relaxing drink after days of traveling.

{% include figure image_path="/images/rt/100.jpg" alt="this is a placeholder image" caption="Mylee & I enjoying a beer @ Richmond" %}

After wrapping up our day of drinking, we proceeded to have dinner with two other friends, Mylee and Lily (not sure if it should be Lily, please confirm). We opted for an elegant seafood and cocktail restaurant, setting the stage for a night filled with festivities. Later, we walked to another bar where we enjoyed drinks and played some billiards before heading home to play Catan.Playing Catan was a fitting activity for this trip, as it held special memories from when Ben would occasionally visit after dropping out. Those visits often involved enjoyable moments of playing Catan with great company. On this trip, playing Catan allowed me to meet another one of Ben's friends, Raquel, whom I would later become well acquainted with.

It's worth noting that most of Ben's friends in El Segundo have known each other since middle school. While I personally only stay in touch with Mateo and two other friends from high school, witnessing their tight-knit community was truly remarkable. I gained valuable insights about Ben and his friends through our conversations. During our two games of Catan, Mylee emerged as the victor both times. It had been a while since I had a board game night, and engaging in this wholesome activity felt comforting and nostalgic. Osagie rejoined us in the middle of one of our games, and thus we concluded our eventful first day in Los Angeles.

#### Day 5: UCLA

On our second day in Los Angeles, we would be heading to UCLA. But before heading there, we had breakfast at a local diner called Wendy's. While it sounds like the fast food chain, one of the many fun facts we learned on the trip was that El Segundo is "anti-chain". Almost everything in El Segundo is a small business and it may be one of the primary reasons why the town feels so homey. We all primarily got the chicken fried chicken which was a chicken patty covered in gravy, with a side of hash browns, egg, and toast. Osagie and I couldn't really get over the fact that everyone was so interconnected in this town by knowing each other's orders and such. And for me I drank so much coffee at this diner that I was feeling super jittery before what would be a long day for my Ph.D. visit at UCLA.

At UCLA, Osagie and I once split up again since today would be a lot of meetings for me. I first met up with my former PI's, Jeffrey Chiang where we caught up about life and potential directions on existing projects. Jeff is a part of this super niche field called AI in medicine where he works on projects related to healthcare. During the summer I helped him expand on an AI system that could predict future blood pressure in the ICU, but now he was interested in an even crazier project. At a very high level, he was describing the ubiquitous data that UCLA has of their patients. And using this data, he wants to build a generative AI model that can predict a representation of a patient in the future. Since AI is quite successful at continuous predictions (regressions), it sounded very exciting and crazy in concept. The motivation behind the project is to be able to assess the health of patients from their current and past medical states (longitudinal data points), to show patient outcomes/risks. The hardest part of this problem from his eyes was trying to connect all the data together to get an interpretable representation of the patient and if all goes well, it is a project I will begin working on as early as the summer.

{% include figure image_path="/images/rt/12.JPG" alt="this is a placeholder image" caption="Professor Jeff & I @ UCLA" %}

Up next I met with the Brunilda Balliu Lab, where she works with applications in digital sensing and functional genetics. Her lab primarily does statistical genetics but I had a relatively high interest due to her work in digital sensing. This is once again a niche field where roughly 3500 patients are currently in a longitudinal study who have openly agreed to share the data from their phones, watches, and other sensors placed around the household (bed sensors, gps, etc.). With this lucrative dataset, the overarching goal is to try and build a medical system that flags patients who might be at risk of depressive episodes at any stage. Her work uses a lot of Apple products and she is therefore a collaborator with Apple which supplies her with computing resources for her research. However, in her eyes, the largest challenge is finding efficient computing tricks to process the petabytes of data being recorded from these patients to produce interpretable insights and overcome type 2 errors (false negatives) in the clinic. Type 2 errors are the doomsday of the clinic in any application of medicine because it means that a disease or condition was not properly identified by the model. For example, if you have a type 2 error when classifying cancer through images, that patient has not been properly diagnosed and is suffering without properly being informed. Therefore, I intend to rotate in her laboratory in the winter quarter due to these interesting applications in digital sensing but want to get more training in statistics & high-performance computing (HPC) before entering. On top of getting to speak to Professor Bruna, I also met with her students which helped me get a gauge of what life would be like at UCLA. They were all kind and shared their experiences and I was happy to hear that many of them retained a good work-life balance even at such an elite institution.

To end the day I went to thank Dr. Akos Rudas, my postdoc who mentored me during the summer, but he, unfortunately, had to leave early to go pick up his kid. However, all was not lost since I ran into Johnson Chen, our other mentor, and Prateek and Aakarsh. Prateek, Aakarsh, Noelle, and Michelle were in the Sriram lab at the time and we shared a space with them to form the *Jeffram* (Jeff + Sriram) Lab. I had a lot of good memories spent in that laboratory and I was happy to see the two of them who were twins. I briefly caught up with them to hear some sad news that they would be splitting up in the summer. With twins, I am always so curious if they are always taken as pairs, but it turns out that sometimes only one of the twins gets an internship and such. However, they were both in good spirits and I was glad I ran into them while passing by the lab.

{% include figure image_path="/images/rt/13.JPG" caption="Prateek & Aakarsh haven't changed one bit XD" %}

After a long day of meetings at UCLA, I met up with Osagie and while we were chilling, we were asked to join in on a game of volleyball with some strangers. That day was one of the few days we got the actual sun, so it was nice to get to do something physical before it would be cloudy again. Once we concluded our time at UCLA, we headed back to El Segundo where we would go celebrate St. Patrick's Day. We met up with some of Ben's old-time friends, and they were the living three stooges. They were so silly that it was hard not to laugh at them. At the bar, we also got to witness a bagpipe performance and it felt very festive all around. My night continued after the bar where I would join Ben and his friends at yet another bar where we would continue our celebrating. I am not sure why St. Patrick's day is celebrated so much but it is one of the premiere holidays for college students and young adults. One of the upsides but also downsides about going out with Ben was that he would hook me up with drinks but in return, I would have to face the consequences of a deathly hangover. So at these bars, I was completely out of it. However, we ended our night getting Subway which brought me back to life before we called it the end of the second day in Los Angeles.

#### Day 6: San Diego

On our sixth day, our plan was to trek down to San Diego. In our original plan we were going to stay the night in SD but feared the 9-13 hour drive home so we decided to just make it just a day trip. That morning we left early to go meet up with our mutual friend Karthik. Karthik is by far one of the most intelligent people I know and I have long been meaning to see him. Throughout his past quarter, we almost met up in Boston when he was interviewing with THE Harvard University. Therefore Osagie and I made the trip down to see him where we went to THE taco stand. Not just any taco stand but THE taco stand. I remember when we were arranging our lunch plans, we initially thought we were going to some random taco stand near La Jolla, but if it wasn't clear already, we went to a place called THE taco stand. San Diego is allegedly known for its tacos and I ended up trying 5 different tacos at THE taco stand: Carne Asada, El Pastor, Grilled Pescado, Camarón Picante, & their store taco. After a delicious lunch, we ended up walking around La Jolla, catching up on life and the future before later departing from Karthik and UCSD. Karthik is likely to be attending Weill Cornell, and I would be happy to see him anytime in New York City.

{% include figure image_path="/images/rt/14.JPG" caption="Karthik, Osagie & I @ La Jolla" %}

Now that we have hit the most southern point of the trip, it was only up from here. On our drive up, we first stopped by Carlsbad, California, where I would meet up with some old old friends. I am talking about my freshman year of college. In this pitstop, we would be meeting with Adam (from San Diego) and Caitlin, who I used to party with frequently in my first year of college. I had not seen both since then and this was a very last-minute plan on our drive up. We met up at a bar called the crackheads where we would catch up on life since we all went our separate ways nearly 3 years ago. The beauty of seeing old friends was the amount of growth that we all have gone through since our naive freshman year days. Though I miss partying with both of them, I was happy to hear that Adam was finishing up his degree in Computer Science, and Caitlin was beginning her career at Johnson & Johnson as a medical devices assistant. Though it was a very brief stop, it was truly good to see them both.

{% include figure image_path="/images/rt/15.JPG" caption="Adam, Caitlin & I @ Crackheads" %}

In the last part of our day, we returned to El Segundo, where we would stay with Ben for one last night. Osagie and I were both freakishly tired but it was a Saturday night... While Osagie made the wise decision to rest up for our long drive home, I decided to go out with Ben one last night. I met Ben at the Richmond bar and we all went wild for our last night. Ben and his friends kept buying me drinks because it was my last night which was a blessing and a curse. That night I hung out a lot with Ben's friend Raquel who I had previously played Catan with and we got along really well. We talked about our lives together while being super hammered and enjoyed each others company for the whole night. All of Ben's friends were truly kind and welcoming people and I am truly jealous of the little friend group they got going in El Segundo. I wished them all farewell that night with intentions to come to visit once I move to Los Angeles. All I have got to say is thank you to Ben, his friends, and El Segundo for hosting the two of us for three eventful days.

#### Day 7 & Conclusion: Drive Back Home

On our last day, we zoomed back to the bay area early in the morning through some pretty brutal weather conditions. We made a pitstop early in the drive and the car doors nearly broke due to the extreme winds in the valleys. I was pretty scared for my life and our trek back home but we ended up making it back pretty early. We first arrived back to Walnut Creek where Osagie would break off to do some work, and I would meet up with my long-time elementary school friend Freddie whom I have known since the 1st grade. I took advantage of Osagie's missing presence by enjoying some Boudin Clam Chowder because Osagie does not eat seafood...

{% include figure image_path="/images/rt/clam.JPG" caption="Freddy & I enjoying some clam chowder *chefs kiss" %}

We would later meet up with one of my old housemates Seth & Kate where we would grab ramen. I had not seen Seth & Kate for nearly 2 years and it was great to catch up with them both. For a very long time Seth & Kate were "not" dating and turned down the rumors for the three plus years I've known him. I was astonished and happy to hear during our dinner that they were indeed dating now after years of speculation. In another note, Seth was by far one of the funniest housemates I had in college, and it was good to see him thriving in his job. He was always a genius and we talked anime, life, and his desire to move to Socal in the coming years. So I look forward to reuiniting with Seth again real soon.

{% include figure image_path="/images/rt/17.JPG" caption="Kate, Seth & the group enjoying ramen in Oakland " %}

After saying farewell to Seth, we made our last stop to Pleasanton where we would meet up with Noah Lawrence, my dear friend. Like every other person on this trip, I had met Noah (and Seth) my freshman year while we were joining the fraternity, but Noah had a lasting impact on my demeanor. Everyone used to call him the "buddy" because he always had a positive energy and a good attitude towards everything regardless of the situation. As a pessimistic 18-year-old, constantly being around Noah helped change my perspective in life. He saw me in my darkest days and was always there to support me no matter the situation. We also used to be gym buddies during Covid and worked out together consistently in that isolating time. We ended up meeting up with Noah pretty late at roughly 11 pm because his current job was having him work extreme hours from 4 am - 10 pm. Together, we all caught up as usual, but then we shifted our attention towards autostereograms, which are 2d repeating sequences that can portray 3d illusions. 

{% include figure image_path="/images/rt/frog.JPG" caption="Autostereogram: Can you see the Bunny???" %}

My next blog will likely be about the science behind autostereograms but all I can say now is how truly fascinating our sight is and can be. To me, this is the definition of magic and I can't wait to share and show this to everyone in Boston. We called the night at roughly 1 am with an early start the next morning at 4:30 am. So the next morning we got up really early to go return the rental car which had an awful return time before 6 am. We made it with plenty of time to spare and this concluded our road trip. I said my goodbyes to Osagie, and I was really grateful that he had such a brilliant idea that made this all possible. This was the end for my trip down memory lane

To close, I just wanted to say how great it was to see everyone on this trip. Friends come and go in our lives but networking has truly shown its value on this trip. I used to hate moving on because it meant you had to say goodbye but I think a good friendship really is a forever thing. So although everyone wasn't frequently in my life, I knew that these people would be there with and for me whenever needed. I had a blast literally going through memory lane with friends from elementary all the way through my college days. So to all that I saw, thank you so much for spending time with the both of us and for all the memories I deeply cherish with each individual person. I hope to see you all soon and I wish you all well. With that said, this concludes this lengthy blog post. Thanks for reading :)

### 2. Miami & Orlando

My second trip I took in the month of March was to Miami, Florida in celebration of my Ph.D. acceptance. Since California was sort of a let down in terms of its weather, it only felt right to go to a place that was guaranteed to be hot. Therefore there was no better place than the sunshine state itself Florida. Miami has long been at the top of the list for places to go in the United States due it being a vibrant and dynamic city known for its lively atmosphere, stunning beaches, and diverse cultural scene. With its year-round tropical climate, Miami offers a paradise-like setting where visitors and residents can enjoy a fusion of Latin American and Caribbean influences. From the iconic Art Deco architecture of South Beach to the bustling nightlife of Downtown Miami, the city pulsates with energy and excitement. Alongside its renowned beach culture, Miami is also a thriving hub for art, music, and culinary experiences, attracting artists, celebrities, and food enthusiasts from around the world. Whether strolling along the vibrant streets of Little Havana, exploring the trendy neighborhoods of Wynwood and Brickell, or soaking up the sun on the pristine sands of Miami Beach, this cosmopolitan city embodies a unique blend of luxury, cultural diversity, and endless entertainment options.

So in the beginning of March, I flew down to Miami to enjoy myself a weekend basking in the sun. Typically when I travel, I have a bad tendency to underestimate distance and this was one of the first challenges I naviagted as I was miles away from the airbnb that I would be staying in. With little to no knowledge on how the city was made up, I had the impression that everywhere within a 3 mile radius was considered Miami. Unfortunately for me, I had myself a 2 hour bus ride north to look forward to because I was actually miles away from where all the lively things occur. But my first impression of Miami were exactly like the TV shows. In my first night, I had grabbed dinner in Brickell which is the financial district of Miami. Therefore, everywhere I looked I was surrounded by super model Latina women and beach ready good looking men. It felt unreal to be in such an environment. I ended up going to a pretty nice seafood restaurant where I enjoyed eating a Miami native fish (Cobia? Red Snapper?). Being asian though, made me feel somewhat out of place being in the midst of this city. I wasn't necessarily rich, had a good body, was extremely attractive, so it made for a quiet dinner. But some things worth mentioning was the beach attire that probably existed year round in Florida. I remember it was nearly 90 degrees and really humid when I arrived at night when in Boston is was below the freezing point. It's really wild to think of how different the world is within a few hours of a flight. I concluded my night with the two hour bus ride north where I would be adjacent to the very north point of South Beach.

The next day, I decided to explore South Beach, and Wynwood. In the morning I decided to go to South Beach since I have long heard of the infamous social and beach scene at this particular location. And again everywhere I went in South Beach, there were beautiful women, super jacked men, as well as a lot of college students. I had gone to Miami during spring break time so everywhere I looked, there appeared to be a group enjoying their spring break. The atmosphere in South Beach is alive with energy, as visitors and locals alike immerse themselves in the lively streets and stunning beaches. From the moment you set foot on Ocean Drive, the heart of South Beach, you're greeted by the iconic Art Deco buildings in vibrant pastel colors, setting a glamorous backdrop for the bustling scene. The streets are lined with trendy restaurants, lively bars, and chic boutiques, creating a pulsating social scene that keeps the party going well into the early hours of the morning. The beach itself is a haven for sun worshippers and water enthusiasts, with its pristine white sands and crystal-clear turquoise waters.

After basking in the sun for a few hours, I made my way back to Wynwood which is another landmark in Miami. Wynwood, located in Miami, Florida, is a vibrant neighborhood that has become a hub for art, creativity, and cultural expression. What was once an industrial area has been transformed into a thriving arts district, attracting visitors from around the world. Wynwood is best known for its colorful and captivating street art, with stunning murals adorning the walls of buildings throughout the neighborhood. Artists from all over have left their mark, creating a dynamic outdoor gallery that showcases a diverse range of styles and themes. As you walk through the streets of Wynwood, you'll encounter a lively and eclectic atmosphere, with artistic expression at every turn. The neighborhood's unique character and artistic flair extend beyond the walls, as vibrant cafes, craft breweries, and hip restaurants serve up a fusion of flavors and experiences. The community in Wynwood is buzzing with creativity, and it often hosts art events, live performances, and cultural festivals that further enhance its energetic ambiance. Whether you're an art enthusiast, a food lover, or simply someone seeking a one-of-a-kind experience, Wynwood offers a vibrant and immersive environment that celebrates the power of art and the spirit of innovation. In Wynwood, I ended up trying a Cuban Sandwich, which is one of the many cultural experiences that is a must try in Miami due to its booming Carribean culture. To my surprise I was slightly let down by the whole experience because a Cuban Sanwich to me seemed like a pretty normal sub. Perhaps I had gone to the wrong restaurant but I was very let down by this whole experience. It was a lot of talk just to be a very mediocre sandwich. 

To conclude my second day, I ended in the Fashion District of Miami because I had heard of a Michelin Star Korean restaurant that had high praise. I had never gone to a Michelen star restaurant outside of just one ramen shop in San Francisco, so I wanted to celebrate my occasion with some great food. But like many places in downtown Miami, the fashion district was no exception. The Fashion District in Miami is a dynamic and stylish neighborhood that serves as a hub for fashion, design, and creativity. Located in the heart of downtown Miami, this district is a haven for fashion enthusiasts, trendsetters, and those seeking unique shopping experiences. The area is home to a wide array of high-end fashion stores, and showrooms, showcasing the latest trends and designs from renowned designers and emerging talents alike. From luxury brands to independent designers, the Fashion District offers a diverse range of shopping options to suit the luxury style that Miami seemed to portray. After browing this area for an hour or so, I was notified that my table had been ready for this fine dining experience at COTE Miami. At COTE I got the Butcher's Feast which featured USDA Prime & American Wagyu Beef, along with a fair share of Korean side dishes: Ban-chan, Scallion salad, Savory Egg Souffle, Kimchi Jigae Dwen-jang Jigae, Lettuce & Ssam-jang, and a Match soft serve for dessert. While the dining experience was nothing like I ever experienced, I was once again slightly let down by the food. The food itself was great but it was hard to decipher what the differences were from a normal Korean restaurant to this Michelen star restaurant. Outside of using expensive ingredients for many of the dishes, it felt as if the flavor was pretty similar which left a bitter taste in my mouth considering the price of the meal. Though it wasn't bad, from this experience I had told myself that fine dining was probably not for me.

On my last day in Miami, I checked out another must do activity which was exploring the everglades that Florida had to offer. When I think about Florida, two things typically come up: Messed up politics and alligators. So avoiding the politics at all cost, I hopped on a tour bus to go check out the alligators. The Florida Everglades is a vast and captivating natural ecosystem located in the southern part of Florida. It is a unique and diverse landscape that encompasses marshes, wetlands, prairies, and forests, creating a one-of-a-kind wilderness unlike any other in the world.Covering approximately 1.5 million acres, the Everglades is a haven for wildlife and serves as an important habitat for numerous species, some of which are endangered or threatened. It is home to iconic animals such as the American alligator, the Florida panther, the West Indian manatee, and a variety of bird species, including the beautiful roseate spoonbill. The Everglades is renowned for its intricate network of waterways, with slow-moving rivers and interconnected marshes that form a complex ecosystem. These waterways are fed by the famous "River of Grass," a shallow, slow-moving sheet of water that flows southward. It creates a unique and fragile ecosystem that supports a rich diversity of plant and animal life. Exploring the Everglades offers visitors a chance to immerse themselves in the beauty and tranquility of nature. On our tour we were lucky enough to hop  on airboats that glide across the marshes to witness the splendor of this natural wonder. While the Everglades showcases the beauty of untouched nature, it also faces environmental challenges and preservation efforts. The delicate balance of this unique ecosystem has been impacted by human activities, such as water diversion and pollution. As a result, ongoing conservation efforts are crucial to protect this invaluable natural treasure and ensure its long-term survival. On our airboat tour, the objective was to obviously go see alligators, but knowing our luck, we were unable to actually see any during the ride. However the engineering behind these airboats was a fascinating experience in itself gliding through the marshes with wind alone. We caught some major speed at time, unintentionally getting wacked by the plants. Though we didn't see the alligators we wanted, it still made more a memorable experince.

That night I had also planned to attend my second NBA basketball game watching two famous franchises going to war. The Miami Heat and the New York Knicks have long had a rivarly amongst one another since the 1990's and I was really on my way to see this showdown. Unfortunately for me, the only times I have seen the NBA live have been in cities where it is ridiculously expensive because the teams are usually good. My first experience watching the NBA was in Boston, and the prices themselves are so utterly ridiculous in that city. Miami was no different. However lucky for us, the game was very entertaining because there was no clear winner throughout most of the game. In fact the game ended in a Julius Randle Masterclass, where he dropped 40 points and a game winner at the buzzer beater. Though it was a sad day for Miami fans, I was thrilled by the value to see such a game live. It was truly entertaining.

The next day was my final day in Florida, and I had to say farewell to Miami. Overall it was a fun experience but it was a city I had no plans on returning to unless it was like another spring break type trip with friends. That morning was unfortunately a pain in the ass though because on my way to the airport, my flight got cancelled and I had to uber nearly an hour to the other airport in Miami. I was lucky enough to meet Hugo who took me around little Havana in an effort to improving my day. You can read more about his kindness and story [here](https://simonlee711.github.io/blogging/cost-kindness/). Once I got to the airport I was on my way to see Tiffanie Crumbie, who I had met at UCLA this past summer. Tiffanie was always a good postive friend that brought out a funny energy to our group. Therefore, since I was in the area, I wanted to make sure to make my way to Orlando to pay her a visit. But again having done zero research, Orlando proved to be a very difficult city to commute in because for miles there was literally nothing in between. Therefore to get into Tiffanie's college campus, I had to bus nearly two hours in this super empty city. However, it wasn't all so bad because this city was in one of my favorite anime's JoJo's Bizzare Adventure: Stone Ocean so it felt cool to be in the same location where that took place. When I finally made it to her campus which is the same school as NBA legend Tako Fall, we had made our way to the Universal Studios City Walk to grab food and check out Orlandos vibrant amusement park frenzy. 

Upon arriving at the Universal City walk, I was surprised to see how busy it was. Orlando was pretty famous for its theme parks, entertainment, and family-friendly attractions so I guess for a lack of better words, there must be nothing else to do in this city. We ended up walking around the city walk which is equivalent to the likes of a Downtown Disney, while trying different foods and desserts and looking at the various themed shops in the area. Though we didn't actually enter Universal studios, there was still plenty to see in this micro city and we even when to the infamous Universal globe. Together we caught up about what life has been like since the summer, and after that we headed to go play some top golf. For those of you who don't know, Topgolf is a unique and innovative entertainment venue that combines golf with a social and interactive experience. It features climate-controlled hitting bays, state-of-the-art technology, and a variety of games and challenges that cater to both golfers and non-golfers, making it a popular destination to get drunk and hit golf balls. I had always wanted to go top golfing but I actually had no prior experience doing any form of golfing aside from mini-golf which was almost like the opposite experience. However we quickly picked up how to swing the clubs and started jacking up golf balls flying nearly 400 ft into the distance. This activity in particular was fun just as a stress reliever although I wasn't stressed at all. All in all I had a ton of fun aside from the fact that we each paid $75 to go top golfing... With this last activity I concluded my trip to Florida and headed back to the airport to go sleep on one of my favorite hotel chains across the world... which was the airport floor. I had gotten so accustomed to sleeping at airports this past year that I felt no different in Orlando. As I dreamed that night, I recalled all the good memories I was able to make on this little getaway to Florida. I look forward to visiting again one day and was grateful to be able to make it down to such a unique and drastically different state.
