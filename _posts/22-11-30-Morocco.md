Africa has always been a dream destination for me. For as long as I was in high school, the history and the exotic environment of Africa had a wide appeal to me. Therefore for this weeks post I wanted to share about my first time experience spent in various areas of Morocco. I traveled to Morocco very much in the off season so it was both great weather conditions as well as very good value. I will try to break up this post into various parts to make it easier to digest.

One of the first misconceptions I had of Morocco and Africa in general was that everywhere is a "safari" like environment. Obviously this is not true because some animals cannot withstand the brutal conditions of the Sahara Desert, so there were many unexpected things I saw. I first landed in Marakkech which is a very large city in the West of Morocco. And to my surprise, the majority of northern Africa is very much a Islamic dominant environment. In fact if I were a map maker, I might even partition northern Africa to be an extension of the middle east. Therefore upon my arrival to the city, I immediately knew that seeing elephants and lions will likely need to be saved for an additional trip. However there was still plenty to see regardless and our journey begins when roughly 12 complete strangers hop on a head east across the rural Atlas Mountains & in the direction of the Sahara Desert.
