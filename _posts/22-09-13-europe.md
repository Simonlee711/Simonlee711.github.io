Living in Europe has brought together totally brand new experiences and a total cultural shock even during my second long-term stay. Today I wanted to bring in light some of the downsides of living in Europe from my single perpective. Though there have been plently up upsides, I sort of wanted to highlight some of the downsides instead. It is almost as if I have taken some key features for granted. * *Disclaimer I am from California, so this might now be a totally fair assessment* *

One of the few downsides to Europe has been the weather. After living in California for many years, it is safe to say that I have taken for granted how nice California is and can be. Even in September, Switzerland has been rather gloomy and already starting to become a little cold. While I do prefer colder temperatures over bakingly hot temperatures, I am not very content with the lack of sunshine that I currently am exposed to. I think weather does indeed make some effect into the mental health of a human being.

Another has been the lack of tall buildings. In Europe for whatever reason, they lack buildings taller than 4 stories. It makes every city seem very small and cramped as well as outdated. I feel as if I am living in a society that is 20 years behind the one I just left in America. Everything here has a vintage feel to it and although it can be cool in some contexts, it is not totally ideal in the rest. 

A third downside has been the general environment the people create. Though I have yet to begin school, I am a little underwhelmed by the lack of openness (is this a word?) within a european society. In America, everyone is rather friendly and what not but over here I have often gotten the cold shoulders from many people on day to day life. It has sort of sheltered me in a way and has limited my interactions with people. I am not sure if it is because I am asian in a predominantly white community but I do feel a little bit out of place being here. I guess it doesn't help not being able to speak the mother tongue but I just get this general sense of unfriendliness from many people. 

However there have been just as many positive experiences, and all in all I am doing well. I begin school a week from today so I am very much looking forward to the very reason I came here and that is to meet all types of scholars from all around the world. I will keep you updated then.
