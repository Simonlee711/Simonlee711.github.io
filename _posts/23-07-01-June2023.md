The month of June was a month full of travel. In the April Blog, I had written about how I was planning a trip with Camilla, and  Japan emerged as a captivating masterpiece of culture, tradition, and modernity. In addition to my personal leisure, I also had plans to visit my grandmother who we recently found out was also sick, so this trip was a mixture of fun and the importance of family. So this month, as I stepped onto Japanese soil, I was instantly enveloped in an intricate dance between the past and the future. From the serene beauty of ancient temples and meticulously maintained gardens to the bustling energy of neon-lit metropolises, Japan seemed to effortlessly balance its rich history with its cutting-edge advancements. This fusion of old and new created a dynamic tapestry that invited me to delve into the heart of this vibrant nation.

Traveling to Japan was an enchanting lesson in cultural immersion. Every corner of this captivating country seemed to hold a unique story, a testament to the diverse regions and their distinctive flavors. The bustling streets of Tokyo, alive with a symphony of sights and sounds, revealed the pulse of urban life. The tranquil landscapes of Kyoto unveiled the poetry of nature, where cherry blossoms painted the scenery in delicate hues. Each encounter with the gracious locals unveiled layers of tradition, from the graceful art of tea ceremonies to the meticulous craftsmanship of centuries-old artisans. This exposure to Japan's multifaceted heritage ignited a sense of curiosity and respect for the interconnectedness of the world's cultures.

The allure of Japan reminded me why traveling is not just an adventure, but an essential facet of life. Exploring a new country offers a passport to broaden horizons, challenge preconceptions, and create cherished memories. The thrill of navigating unfamiliar streets, deciphering foreign languages, and savoring exotic cuisines stirs a sense of excitement that rekindles the childlike wonder within us. Beyond the sensory delights, travel fosters personal growth by encouraging adaptability, resilience, and an open-minded approach. Each encounter with different landscapes and people enriches the tapestry of our own lives, leaving us with a deeper understanding of our world and our place within it.

In Japan, I discovered that the joy of travel lies not only in the remarkable places we visit, but also in the profound impact it has on our perspective. It reminds us that the world is vast, diverse, and full of treasures waiting to be unearthed. Traveling teaches us to embrace the beauty of human connection, transcending cultural boundaries and uniting us in our shared humanity. Whether admiring the majestic Mount Fuji, wandering through ancient shrines, or savoring delectable street food, every moment spent exploring Japan reaffirmed the timeless truth: the world is a wondrous playground, and travel is the key that unlocks its marvels.

# One Big highlight

This month was filled with strictly just traveling. Therefore instead of dividing it into three highlights like we traditionally do, this month is just one giant highlight. Similar to the one from March 2023 newsletter, this one should be fairly lengthy since there is a lot to cover. So in the proceeding sections, I've decided to divide the blog into the different cities I got to visit during my time there (because there are quite a lot) and share the highlights accordingly.

# Tokyo

Nestled in the heart of Japan, Tokyo emerges as a captivating metropolis that pulsates with vibrant energy and innovation. A mesmerizing blend of modernity and tradition, this city stands as a testament to the remarkable fusion of technological advancement and cultural heritage. Skyscrapers adorned with neon lights dominate the skyline, creating an awe-inspiring urban panorama that comes alive as the sun sets. Amid this high-tech backdrop, ancient temples and tranquil gardens provide oases of serenity, where visitors can step back in time and immerse themselves in the profound rituals and history of Japan. The city's efficient public transportation system, a testament to its forward-thinking infrastructure, seamlessly connects its diverse neighborhoods, each offering a unique atmosphere and flavor. From the bustling streets of Shibuya, where the iconic scramble crossing draws crowds in a symphony of motion, to the serene corridors of Asakusa's Senso-ji Temple, Tokyo's dynamic diversity envelops you at every turn. Its culinary landscape is a tantalizing adventure, with world-class sushi bars, bustling izakayas, and bustling street food stalls, inviting travelers to indulge in an unparalleled gastronomic journey. Tokyo's exceptional ability to balance innovation and tradition, modernity and history, makes it an exhilarating destination that leaves an indelible mark on the senses and the soul.

Truth is, I can't really get enough of this place. Similar to my love for New York City, Tokyo has that same attraction factor with how mesmerizing the city truly is. As someone who is drawn by stimulations, there really isn't a better place than Tokyo, better yet Japan that is a master at that. No matter how narrow a street is, you never know what you will find and it is especially beautiful when the city turns into a literal Cyberpunk 2077 map as the sunsets across the beautiful horizon. Some may find the bright lights, and the stimulation to be overwhelming, and truthfully it is, but I still love every part of it. If I am not mistaken, Tokyo is the most densely populated city in the world mixed with locals and tourists alike navigating through this bustling city. But even through all the chaos and the people, there seems to be a sense of peace and stability knowing how functional the city is. So in that sense, the city is just as beautiful.

Therefore, I had touched down in Tokyo which began the start to my trip. The plan for the next 40 days was to spend some time in Tokyo, adventure out west to many cities along the country (hitting the most southern point of the main Island of Kagoshima), visiting my grandparents, then eventually climbing Fuji-san (Mt. Fuji) at the start of July. I tried describing this to some of the people I met whenever we'd talk but instead of me doing the talking I thought I'd draw out my trip summarized in a basic infographic:

### Tokyo Adventures A: Going Clubbing

One of the first activities I got around to when I touched down in Tokyo was meeting up with the plethora of friends that were in Japan from Boston. In my first week there, I had met up with Camilla, who we met in Aprils blog, Carlo Hensch, who I will introduce later, and Mikey from MIT who we met in the February blog. I was estatic from my point of view because whil my past year has been filled with lots of travel, it has been some time since I had traveled with many friends. Therefore in my second night there, we decided to go out and enjoy Shibuya's club scene where I would first meet with Carlo and his friend Si Chiang Wu. All the people I was meeting up with that night were from Harvard, all here for their own reasons. I had met Carlo way back because he was good friends with Van & Giselle, and he was here completing an architecture internship at a Japanese firm. His friend Si, was here for a shorter duration where he had plans of checking out different Japanese shrine architectures for his research project. And Camilla was here strictly just for vacation. But we got our night started between Si, Carlo and I and enjoyed some light drinks and food at an Izakaya which can be found everywhere in Japan. An izakaya is a casual Japanese dining spot, akin to a pub, where people gather to enjoy small plates of food and drinks. It offers a relaxed atmosphere for socializing with friends and colleagues, featuring a menu of traditional and contemporary dishes like skewered and grilled items, fried foods, and more. It's a popular place for unwinding, sharing conversations, and savoring a variety of Japanese cuisine and alcoholic beverages. We had all known how to conversationally speak Japanese, but for all of us, there was some degree of rust since we didn't really use the language much in the States.

And after muching and drinking a variety of Japanese foods and drinks, we had met up with Camilla who was coming from Yokohama, where she was staying with her grandparents. However, like all the places in the world, it was still a little too early to go out to any clubs and so we elected to get any recommendations of places to go drink in Shibuya. Therefore Camilla who was the most fluent out of all of us started asking locals at the Hachiko Statue, where to go. We would quickly recruit two more lads, who of which I would forget their names, and they would take us to another fun drinking spot in the area. Here we talked all about our backgrounds, how we met, and enjoyed the camraderie of drinking with our new friends. Japan would slowly become a lethal weapon to all of us because the prices of going out here were incomparable to those in the States. You could get a cocktail here for 600 Yen which was equivalent to roughly $4 USD while the cheapest options are no less than $13-15 USD when including a tip. Therefore, we had figured out really early that it wouldn't be difficult to have a good time from these really cheap prices. Another lovely aspect of Japan, was that there was no tipping culture and that tax is typically precalculated on the menu for you. As of late, tipping has gone wild in the US, and nowadays they ask for tips for just ordering your food... However that is a topic for another day and it was safe to say we were relieved of tips in Japan.

Once the clock inched its way towards midnight, we were all pretty tipsy as we made our way to the club scene. This meant, that all of us were a far bit more social and we were inclined to continue making friends. We therefore asked around, joined random groups of locals and asked where the best places were to go. I think it really helped that we had Camilla, since she was a girl, and all the men were willing to give good recommendations. We therefore found ourselves at the TK NIGHTCLUB, which is one of the best nightclubs in the Shibuya area.
