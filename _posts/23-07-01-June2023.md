六月は旅行の月でいっぱいでした。4月のブログでは、Camillaとの旅行を計画していることについて書きましたが、日本は文化、伝統、そして現代性の見事な傑作として浮かび上がりました。私自身の楽しみに加えて、最近祖母が病気だとわかったので、この旅行は楽しみと家族の重要性の組み合わせでした。だから今月、日本の土地に足を踏み入れると、私は瞬時に過去と未来の複雑なダンスに包まれました。古代の寺院や入念に手入れされた庭園の静かな美しさから、ネオンで照らされた大都市の賑やかなエネルギーまで、日本はその豊かな歴史と最先端の進歩を努力せずにバランス良く保つように見えました。新旧の融合は、私にこの鮮やかな国の中心に没入するよう招待しました。

日本への旅行は文化の浸漬の魅力的な授業でした。この魅力的な国のすべての角には、ユニークなストーリーがあるようで、それは異なる地域とそれらの独自の風味の証です。東京の賑やかな街の通りは、視覚と音の交響曲で生き生きとした都市生活を表現していました。京都の静かな風景は、桜の花が繊細な色合いで風景を彩る自然の詩を明らかにしました。親切な地元の人々とのすべての出会いは、お茶会の優雅な芸術から数世紀前の職人の慎重な職人技術まで、伝統のレイヤーを明らかにしました。日本の多様な遺産に触れることは、世界の文化のつながりに対する好奇心と尊敬の感覚を刺激しました。

日本の魅力は、旅行が冒険だけでなく、人生の不可欠な側面である理由を私に思い出させました。新しい国を探索することは、視野を広げ、偏見に挑戦し、大切な思い出を作るためのパスポートを提供します。見慣れない通りを歩き、外国語を解読し、エキゾチックな料理を味わう興奮を感じることは、私たちの内にある子供のような驚きを再燃させます。感覚的な喜び以外にも、旅行は適応能力、抵抗力、そして開かれた考え方を奨励することで、個人の成長を促します。異なる風景や人々との出会いは、私たち自身の人生の織りを豊かにし、世界と私たち自身の位置を深く理解させてくれます。

日本で私は旅行の喜びは、訪れる素晴らしい場所だけでなく、私たちの視点に与える深い影響にあることを発見しました。それは世界が広大で多様で、発掘を待っている宝物でいっぱいであることを私たちに思い出させてくれます。旅行は文化の境界を超えて文化的な境界を超え、私たちを共有の人間性で結びつけることで、人間のつながりの美しさを受け入れるように教えてくれます。壮大な富士山を称賛したり、古代の神社を歩いたり、美味しい屋台の食べ物を楽しんだりするたびに、日本を探索するすべての瞬間が、世界は驚異的な遊び場であり、旅行はその驚異を解き放つ鍵であるという不変の真実を再確認しました。

# 大きなハイライト (One Big Highlight)

今月は純粋に旅行で満たされていました。従来通り3つのハイライトに分割する代わりに、今月は1つの巨大なハイライトです。2023年3月のニュースレターと同様に、これはかなり長いものになるはずです。したがって、次のセクションでは、私がその間に訪れた異なる都市にブログを分割し、それに応じてハイライトを共有することにしました（なぜなら、それなりに多くの都市があるからです）。

# 東京 (Tokyo)

日本の中心に位置する東京は、活気と革新の息づく魅力的な大都市として広がります。現代と伝統の見事な融合を象徴する、魅惑的な都市です。ネオンライトで飾られた超高層ビルが都市の空を支配し、太陽が沈むと都市全体が息を吹き返す壮大な都市のパノラマが広がります。このハイテクなバックドロップの中で、古代の寺院や静かな庭園が、訪れる人々が時間を遡り、日本の厳粛な儀式や歴史に身を浸すオアシスとなっています。都市の効率的な公共交通システムは、その先見の明るいインフラを示すもので、多様な地域をシームレスにつなげ、各地域が独自の雰囲気と風味を提供しています。渋谷のにぎやかな通りから始まり、アサクサの浅草寺の静かな回廊まで、東京のダイナミックな多様性があなたを包み込みます。その食文化は魅力的な冒険であり、世界クラスの寿司バー、賑やかな居酒屋、にぎやかな屋台が、旅行者を並外れた美食の旅に誘います。東京は革新と伝統、現代と歴史をバランス良く調和させる卓越した能力を持つため、感覚と魂に忘れられない印象を残す刺激的な目的地となっています。

実際のところ、この場所には本当に飽きることがありません。ニューヨーク市への愛と同様に、東京は本当に魅力的な都市であり、都市がいかに魅力的であるかについて同じ魅力を持っています。刺激に引かれる人として、東京や日本はまさにそれを極めた場所と言えるでしょう。道路がいかに狭くても、何を見つけるか分からないのが美しく、夕日が美しい地平線に沈むと、都市が文字通りサイバーパンク2077の地図に変わるのが特に美しいです。明るい光や刺激が圧倒的であると感じるかもしれませんが、実際にそうなのですが、それでも私はそれをすべて愛しています。おそらく東京は世界で最も人口密度の高い都市であり、地元の人々と観光客が共に賑やかな都市を巡る中で、混沌と人々の中で、都市がいかに機能的であるかという安定感があります。したがって、その意味で、この都市も美しいのです。

したがって、私は東京に到着し、それが私の旅の始まりでした。次の40日間の計画は、東京で過ごし、国内の多くの都市に冒険に出かけ（鹿児島本島の最南端に到達）、祖父母を訪ね、最終的に7月初旬に富士山（富士山）に登ることでした。私はこれをいくつかの人々に話すときに説明しようとしましたが、話す代わりに、私の旅を基本的なインフォグラフィックでまとめることにしました。

### Tokyo Adventures A: Going Clubbing

東京に到着した直後、最初のアクティビティの一つは、ボストンからの多くの友達と再会しました。初週には、[4月のブログ](https://simonlee711.github.io/blogging/Apr2023/)でお会いしたCamillaと、後で紹介されるCarlo Hensch、そして[2月のブログ](https://simonlee711.github.io/blogging/Feb2023/)で紹介されたMITのMikeyと共に過ごしました。私の視点からは、このような友達と一緒に旅行するのは久しぶりで、特に興奮しました。したがって、2日目の夜には、渋谷の活気あるクラブシーンを探索することにしました。そこで、Carloと彼の友達のSi Chiang Wuに出会いました。彼らはすべてハーバードの関連学生で、それぞれ日本にいる理由がありました。

Van＆Giselleとの友情を通じてCarloを知っていたので、再会できてうれしかったです。Carloは日本の建築会社でのインターンシップを追求しており、彼の友達のSiは日本の神社建築を学ぶために短期間で来日しました。一方、Camillaは純粋にバケーションでした。私たちの夜は、居酒屋で軽食と飲み物から始まりました。居酒屋は、パブに似た日本のカジュアルなダイニングスポットで、食事と飲み物の小皿を楽しむ環境を提供し、リラックスと友情を育む場所です。メニューには串、焼き物、揚げ物など、伝統的な料理から現代的な料理まで幅広い料理が含まれており、日本の料理と飲み物を楽しむ場所として人気です。日本語で会話できるものの、アメリカでの言語の使用が限られていたため、言語のぎこちなさが残りました。

さまざまな日本料理とドリンクを楽しんだ後、私たちは神奈川に祖父母と一緒にいたCamillaと再会しました。クラブにはまだ早かったので、渋谷交差点の有名なハチ公の記念碑で飲む場所のおすすめを求めました。私たちの中で最も流暢なのはCamillaで、この場所の近くで現地の人々と会話して適切な場所を特定しました。すぐに新しい知り合い2人が加わり、周辺の楽しい飲み場に冒険しました。私たちのバックグラウンドや出会い方についての会話が流れ、新しい友達との友情を楽しみました。徐々に、日本は夜遊びに適した費用対効果の高い目的地として魅力を発揮し、カクテルが約600円（約4ドル）から提供され、これはしばしば13〜15ドルを超えることがある米国の価格とは対照的でした。日本のチップの習慣がない文化と、税金が事前に計算されていることが、進化するチップのトレンドからの一時的な休息を提供し、私たちの楽しみに貢献しました。

{% include figure image_path="/images/2023/j2.JPG" alt="this is a placeholder image" caption="新しい友達との居酒屋2号店" %}

深夜が近づくにつれ、私たちは陽気な状態になり、クラブシーンに入り込んでいきました。遅い時間が社交性を増幅させるようで、新しいつながりを求めて活発になりました。私たちは現地の人々と交流し、最適な場所について尋ねたり、ランダムなグループに参加しておすすめを集めたりしました。カミラの存在は、女性であることから有利で、彼女の問い合わせは男性の客から好意的なアドバイスを引き出しました。これが私たちを渋谷の有名なエスケーナイトクラブ（TK NIGHTCLUB）に導きました。この時点から、出来事はややぼんやりとしたものになり、何時間も連続で飲み続けるうちに時間が過ぎていきました。酩酊の進行は、トイレの訪問頻度と線形的に関連しているようで、私が飲む量が増えるほど、頻繁にトイレに行くことになりました。私はトイレが必要で、長い列に並ばなければならない状況に直面し、クラブ内で非伝統的な選択をすることにしました。

祭りの最中、私たちはクラブの雰囲気の中で新しい友情を築きましたが、いくつかの人々がカミラに声をかけ始めたとき、事態は不快な方向に向かいました。日本の「rizz」ラーたちは力を発揮し、多くの人々が誤解を抱いていました。どこかで、私は何故かクラブから追い出され、用心棒が再入場前に20分待つようにと言ってきました。そのため、私たちは近くのファミリーマートコンビニエンスストアに向かい、飲酒の冒険を再開しました。私の飲み物を買う癖は続き、カミラ、私自身、そして新たに見つけた仲間にも利益をもたらしました。幸いなことに、日本のビールの価格は約70セントと低く、救いでした。私のタイムアウト中に、ファミリーマートには2人の面白いキャラクターが加わりました。一人は「プロ」ボクサーで、もう一人はトレーナーで、前者は身長5フィート6インチで、予想される身長よりも幼い印象でした。笑いの中で、私たちは言葉を交わし、生活のストーリーを共有し、屋外でビールを楽しみました。

{% include figure image_path="/images/post_photos/june2023/2.JPG" alt="this is a placeholder image" caption="ファミリーマートでのボクサーとトレーナーの友達" %}

このパターンは夜通し続き、最終的に午前4時頃に家に戻る決断をするまで続きました。ホテルの早いチェックアウトが午前11時に予定されていたにもかかわらず、なんとか帰る方法を見つけました（そして時間通りにチェックアウトしました！）。記憶の霧の中で、私はタクシーを呼んだようで、最初に間違った住所を入力しましたが、最終的にはホテルにたどり着きました。それは忘れられない夜であり、日本での冒険の始まりに多くの出来事が詰まっていました。日本の社交シーンへのさらなる没頭を楽しみに、この旅の中で展開されるであろう冒険を熱望してわくわくしていました。

### Tokyo Adventures B: Laufey Concert & Aya-san

東京からもう一つ言及すべき思い出は、独自の手段を通じてまた新しい友達を作ったことです。一緒に来た友達はそれぞれ異なる理由でここにいるため、当然ながら初めの数日は自分の時間がありました。そのため、東京を探索し、それが提供するすべてを探したいと思いました。東京の公共交通機関は非常に素晴らしく、その複雑さにもかかわらず、どこにでも簡単に行くことができます。しかし、山手線というものがあります。おそらく最も有名な路線で、そのルートは都市を一周しています。

{% include figure image_path="/images/post_photos/june2023/3.png" alt="this is a placeholder image" caption="東京の地下鉄マップ" %}

私にとって、山手線沿線のすべての場所を訪れることは常に目標でした。なぜなら、このルートはこの都市のさまざまなマイクロシティの多くをカバーしているからです。上野、新橋、秋葉原、池袋など、注目すべき名前のいくつかがありましたが、このルートには合計で約30のマイクロシティがありました。多くの観光客は従来、新宿や渋谷などのスポットを訪れてきましたが、これらの場所が東京の文化的な経験全体を提供してくれるとは思いません。したがって、私にとっては、この旅行で他のいくつかの場所にも立ち寄りたかったのです。しかし、地下鉄に乗る代わりに、私は足が動かなくなるまで大きな円を歩くことを選びました。7月の初めに、富士山に登る予定があったので、山登りのために足をトレーニングするためにそれまでにたくさん歩きたいと思っていました。しかし、その日、私は東京の「隠れた」通りをほぼ24キロ歩いたと思います。何時間も歩く秘訣は、絶えず食べたり飲んだりして、エネルギーを補給しながら水分を補給することです。そして、この散歩では、地元の人々が列を作っているレストランに立ち寄ることが多かったです。これは、食べ物がおいしいか、安いか、またはその両方を保証していることを意味します。しかし、話を戻して、市内を歩き回るこの長いツアーの終わりに、私はホテルのある浅草に向かう途中でした。しかし、その日は私の好きなアーティストであるLaufeyのコンサートがあったため（チケットを確保できませんでした...）、コンサートが夜に終わる頃でした。そして、このコンサートは小さなジャズクラブで行われたので、東京の街角でLaufeyに会う価値があるかもしれないと思いました。私が「ブルーノート」の会場に着いたとき、そこには別の女の子も待っていました。彼女も私と同じ考えを持っているかもしれないと仮定しましたが、私は会話をしていない間はわかりませんでした。これが私が東京で作った別の友達であり、私たちは実際に同じ考えを持っていたことを知りました。彼女の名前はアヤで、私たちは日本語で会話を始めましたが、私の日本語があまり得意ではないと伝えました。驚いたことに、彼女はほぼ流暢に英語を話すことができました。なぜなら、彼女は神戸の特別な高校に通っており、そこでは完全に英語で教えられていたからです。これにより、私たちの会話の範囲が拡大し、アヤがどのような人物かの大まかなスケッチを学ぶことができました。時間が経つにつれて、待つという私たちの天才的なアイデアは、同じ考えを持つ人々が増えるにつれて門前払いにされなくなりました。しかし、最終的には私たちの願いがかないました。私たちはLaufeyと一緒にグループ写真を撮ることができ、私が一声かけた後でした。これはLaufeyに会って、新しい友達を作るという点でのミッションの成功でした。

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Tokyo 💙 daisuki da yo 😘 <a href="https://t.co/1nNbkefC3L">https://t.co/1nNbkefC3L</a> <a href="https://t.co/gcNLJoJ0Gn">pic.twitter.com/gcNLJoJ0Gn</a></p>&mdash; Michael Rose (@mmistakes) <a href="https://twitter.com/laufey/status/1665728391796994052">June 5, 2023</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

しかし、物語はここで終わりません。短時間であったアヤさんを知ってみて、彼女は本当にクールだと思いました。そして、より深い友情を築くために、東京を離れる前にもう一度彼女と遊びたかったのです。そして、過去の1年間、友人のOsagieから、何かを頼まない限り、わからないことがあると教わりました。そして、頼むことで最悪の場合は相手が「いいえ」と言うだけです。彼の論理的な考え方はあまりにも納得でき、私を快適なゾーンを超えて押し進めました。したがって、私はアヤさんに再び夕食を一緒にとることに興味があるか尋ねました、そして彼女は「はい」と答えました！したがって、私たちは将来の予定を立て、Reikyōという台湾レストランに行くことにしました。そして、彼女は本当にクールな人間でした。彼女は現在、音楽業界で働いており、東京に住んでいながらコンサートに行き、アメリカの文化と交流し続けていました。彼女の人生は私の目には本当に楽しそうで、彼女の人生を聞くだけで、いつか日本に行きたいと思わせるものでした。ボストンは独自のユニークな経験ではあったが、都市内にも階層が存在し、東京とボストンはまったく比較できないように思えた。私たちは食事を楽しんで、その後デザートも食べて、それから一日を終えることにしました。その日、そのような優しい人に出会えてうれしかったし、いつか彼女と再び繋がりたいと思っています :)

# Nagano

While there were numerous other experiences I enjoyed in Tokyo, the constraints of space prevent me from detailing them all. To provide a brief overview, I immersed myself in an authentic green tea ceremony, savored a variety of Japanese delicacies (Suki-yaki, Okonomiyaki, Tsukiji Fish Market Poki-type bowl, Parfaits, and more), attended a classical concert in a planetarium, visited a massive Life-sized Gundam statue and embraced Japanese fashion. The subsequent part of my journey took me westward across multiple locations in Japan, exploring various nature-centric and unique activities across different prefectures. As a foreigner, the advantage of being in Japan is the availability of JR passes, allowing unlimited access to the extensive railway network operated by Japan Railways Group. The JR Pass is an invaluable tool for tourists, granting cost-effective travel across the country, including on the iconic Shinkansen (bullet trains). With plans to visit ten main cities in the next 14 days, my first destination was Nagano.

Situated in the heart of Japan's breathtaking mountainous landscape, Nagano is a captivating city seamlessly blending natural beauty, rich history, and cultural significance. Encircled by the majestic Northern Alps, the region offers a stunning backdrop for a variety of outdoor activities. Winter transforms Nagano into a picturesque wonderland, attracting winter sports enthusiasts to its top-notch slopes in places like Hakuba and Shiga Kogen. As the host of the 1998 Winter Olympics, Nagano gained international acclaim, spotlighting its exceptional winter sports facilities and drawing enthusiasts from around the world. The iconic Zenko-ji Temple, a revered Buddhist pilgrimage site, provides spiritual solace and cultural immersion. Nagano effortlessly fuses tradition and modernity, creating a destination that beckons exploration and introspection alike.

My visit to Nagano was driven by two primary reasons. First, I was eager to witness the exquisite architecture of Zenko-ji Temple up close, observing its unique beauty and contrasting it with other Buddhist shrines across Japan. Secondly, I was particularly excited about visiting Jigokudani Yaen Koen, also known as Snow Monkey Park. This renowned park is home to resident Japanese macaques, famously known as "snow monkeys," who are known for their behavior of soaking in natural hot springs during the winter months. The name "Jigokudani," meaning "Hell's Valley," aptly reflects the area's rugged and volcanic terrain.

### Zenko-ji Temple (善光寺)

Exploring Zenko-ji Temple was a truly captivating journey that immersed me in the heart of Japanese spirituality and history. As I approached the temple's grand gate, I was immediately struck by the air of reverence and tranquility that enveloped the surroundings. The centuries-old architecture, adorned with intricate carvings and vibrant red accents, stood as a testament to the temple's significance as one of Japan's oldest and most revered pilgrimage sites. The aura of solemnity was further enhanced by the footsteps of pilgrims who had journeyed from all corners of the country to pay their respects.

Stepping inside the temple complex, I found myself enveloped in a sense of reverence as I navigated the labyrinthine hallways, dimly lit by the soft glow of lanterns. The atmosphere was palpably serene, inviting moments of introspection and contemplation. As I ventured deeper, I encountered the main hall, where a resplendent golden statue of Amida Buddha rested, exuding a sense of divine presence. The temple's atmosphere, a blend of spiritual devotion and cultural heritage, stirred a profound sense of connection to Japan's rich past and its enduring traditions. Exploring Zenko-ji Temple became an immersive experience that transcended time, allowing me to grasp the essence of Japanese spirituality and the depth of its cultural significance. But the best part of this little excursion was being able to try Soba Noodles, which was one of Nagano's culinary strongsuits.

### Jigokudani Yaen Koen (地獄谷野猿公苑)

At last, we were on our way to Jigokudani Yaen Koen. However, as it might have become evident from my previous travel-related posts, I'm not particularly proactive when it comes to planning things in advance. Today was no exception. In truth, the monkeys are quite a distance from Nagano itself, requiring a series of train rides to reach the mountain city. Once there, a bus ride was needed to access the trail leading to the park. I discovered all of this just moments before heading to the park, adding an element of stress to the journey.

After about an hour, I arrived in Yudanaka by train, where the park was situated. However, my adventure hit another snag when I found myself unsure of where to disembark from the bus en route to the trail. This led to a higher ascent into the mountains before I finally mustered the courage to ask the bus driver for directions. He informed me that I had missed my stop by around three stations and would have to wait approximately 40 minutes for the bus to head in the opposite direction. At this point, it was already around 3:30 pm, and I thought my chances of seeing the bathing monkeys were slim. But this was precisely the reason I avoid excessive planning. Traveling often brings unexpected events, leading to necessary deviations from the original plan. While I felt the internal stress of possibly missing out on the monkeys, I also found comfort in knowing that these detours are part of the journey. But on the bright side, I got to go deeper into the mountains of Yudanaka and get a beautiful view.

{% include figure image_path="/images/post_photos/june2023/8.JPG" alt="this is a placeholder image" caption="Embracing the middle of nowhere" %}

Fortunately, the bus arrived promptly, as is the norm with public transportation in Japan. Once I reached the trailhead, I faced a roughly 20-minute uphill hike, made slightly challenging by the terrain. Determined to maximize my time with the monkeys, I managed to complete the hike in just 15 minutes, arriving at the park approximately 40 minutes before closing time. Despite the short duration of my stay at the park, every second was well worth it.

An aspect I hadn't taken into account during this trip was whether the monkeys would even be present. Luckily for me, the park was bustling with a multitude of monkeys, ranging from sleeping to walking and even bathing. Witnessing the Japanese monkeys leisurely enjoying the warm natural hot spring was both enchanting and entertaining. Observing these playful creatures engaging in water play and grooming one another brought sheer delight. Adding to the charm, it happened to be their breeding season, resulting in numerous adorable baby monkeys gracing the park. Amidst all the initial stress, the experience was undeniably rewarding, creating indelible memories of my encounter with these captivating animals.

# Takayama

The next stop was Takayama which was a gem and became one of my favorite spots in Japan. Takayama, found in the heart of the Japanese Alps, is a picturesque town known for its rich history, preserved Edo-period streets, and stunning natural beauty. Visitors to Takayama are immediately captivated by its quaint charm, as the town exudes a sense of timelessness with its traditional wooden buildings, narrow lanes, and the serene Miyagawa River flowing through its center. 

One of the main attractions of Takayama is its old town, often referred to as "Sanmachi Suji." This historic district transports visitors back in time, offering a glimpse into Japan's past with its preserved architecture and artisan shops. Strolling through Sanmachi Suji, one can explore traditional craft shops, sake breweries, and local eateries, creating an immersive experience of Japanese culture and craftsmanship. 

{% include figure image_path="/images/post_photos/june2023/10.JPG" alt="this is a placeholder image" caption="Sanmachi Suji" %}

Another main reason, and my primary reason for visiting was to check out the hot spring experience in Takayama, which offers a rejuvenating immersion into Japanese tradition and relaxation. Known as "onsen," these natural hot springs are an integral part of the town's culture. Takayama boasts a variety of onsen resorts and public bathhouses where visitors can unwind amidst picturesque surroundings. At these onsen, you'll have the opportunity to soak in mineral-rich thermal waters, believed to have therapeutic properties that can alleviate stress and muscle tension. The tranquil ambiance of the surroundings, often set against lush landscapes, enhances the sense of serenity during your soak. Therefore in Takayama, I was able to enjoy the Sanmachi Suji, some really tasty foods, and soak into the onsen to make for a relaxing day.

# Shirakawa-go

As I ventured into the serene landscapes of Gifu Prefecture in Japan, I found myself captivated by the enchanting village of Shirakawa-go. This UNESCO World Heritage Site, renowned for its gassho-zukuri farmhouses, truly transported me to a bygone era. These remarkable thatched-roof structures, with their steep slopes resembling hands clasped in prayer, showcased the ingenious architectural prowess of the local community in braving the region's heavy snowfall. But what is a UNESCO World Heritage site?

A UNESCO World Heritage Site is a place, landmark, or area that is recognized and designated by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) as having cultural, historical, scientific, or natural significance of global importance. These sites are considered to be of exceptional value and are preserved and protected to ensure their conservation for future generations. UNESCO designates two main types of World Heritage Sites: cultural sites, which typically include historical buildings, cities, and cultural landscapes, and natural sites, which encompass natural wonders, national parks, and areas of outstanding natural beauty. The aim of these designations is to promote awareness, understanding, and appreciation of the diverse and irreplaceable heritage that exists across the globe.

Wandering through the village, especially the picturesque Ogimachi district, felt like stepping into a living museum. Narrow pathways flanked by these iconic farmhouses revealed a harmonious blend of tradition and tranquility. Rumor has it that the winter months adds an extra layer of magic, as the village transformed into a snow-covered wonderland, casting an enchanting spell over the entire landscape. However, summer was plenty beautiful and it was a great experience to visit one of the UNESCO heritage sites. My journey through Shirakawa-go was a remarkable blend of history, nature, and yet again unique culture. It allowed me to step back in time, surrounded by the echoes of rural Japan's past, while forging connections with the warm-hearted locals who generously shared their traditions and heritage.

# Nagoya

The next destination on our trip was to the city that doesn't get talked about enough despite its size. Though it doesn't have the glamour of Tokyo or the cultural significance of Kyoto or Osaka, Nagoya remains a fun place to visit for several reasons. Known for its impressive Nagoya Castle, I was captivated by the intricate architecture and rich history that the castle grounds held. The city's dynamic atmosphere was evident as I wandered through bustling streets, discovering unique shops, bustling markets, and a diverse culinary scene that satisfied every craving (Hitsumabushi., Kishi-men, & Miso Katsu). One highlight was walking in the modern side of town, which was equally enthralling, as I marveled at its innovative urban spaces and iconic landmarks like the Nagoya TV Tower. I had a very fond memory dating back to the year 2019, where the last time I came to the TV Tower, there was some Anime Cosplay event going on, so this place in partiuclar left a good memory in my head.

### Ghibli Park (ジブリパーク)

While I ventured through Nagoya, one of the most enchanting experiences was my visit to the Ghibli Park. The reason, I was visiting Nagoya for a second time was due to this attraction that opened up in November 2022. This whimsical haven brought to life the magic of Studio Ghibli's beloved animated films. Stepping inside felt like entering a dream world, with intricate details from films like "My Neighbor Totoro," "Spirited Away," and "Princess Mononoke" woven into every corner. The park's architecture itself seemed plucked from a Ghibli masterpiece, with winding staircases, hidden nooks, and playful designs that captured the essence of the studio's creativity. Exploring the exhibits, I was treated to exclusive glimpses behind the scenes, from the intricate hand-drawn animation process to the careful craftsmanship that goes into producing each frame. The rooftop garden was a delight, adorned with the iconic Robot Soldier from "Castle in the Sky," standing as a sentinel overlooking the enchanting surroundings. My time at the Ghibli Park was a surreal blend of nostalgia, artistry, and imagination, making it a cherished highlight of my Nagoya journey. And Oh I can't forget that I was able to visit my dear friend Totoro & Cat Bus!

### Food

Truth is every city in Japan was deserving of a food section. I tried so many unqiue foods on this trip, but one of the standouts on this trip for food was in Nagoya. Therefore, while in Nagoya, my taste buds embarked on a delightful culinary adventure, indulging in some truly unique local dishes. Hitsumabushi, a dish that stood out to me, is a grilled eel delicacy served in three distinct ways. The ritual of enjoying it involves savoring the eel in three portions: eating it as is, mixing it with condiments, and then enjoying it with broth and rice. This multi-step experience added depth to the flavors and allowed me to fully appreciate the complexity of this Nagoya specialty.

{% include figure image_path="/images/post_photos/june2023/17.JPG" alt="this is a placeholder image" caption="Hitsumabushi" %}

Another standout was Kishi-men, a cold noodle dish that's perfect for beating the heat. The noodles are served with a flavorful dipping sauce made from soy sauce, dashi, and mirin, creating a refreshing and satisfying combination. The unique texture of the noodles and the vibrant flavors of the sauce made Kishi-men a delightful discovery. And then there's Miso Katsu, a local twist on the beloved Japanese comfort food, tonkatsu. What sets Miso Katsu apart is the use of a rich and savory red miso sauce that's generously drizzled over the crispy breaded pork cutlet. This distinctive twist added a burst of umami to the dish, giving me a taste of Nagoya's culinary creativity.

# Okayama & Kurashiki

When I ventured to Okayama and Kurashiki, I was greeted by a blend of traditional charm and modern vibrancy. Okayama, often referred to as the "Land of Sunshine," lived up to its name with a welcoming atmosphere. The picturesque Korakuen Garden, one of Japan's Three Great Gardens, left me in awe with its meticulously designed landscapes, teahouses, and serene ponds. The nearby Okayama Castle, a symbol of the city's history, provided a glimpse into feudal Japan and offered panoramic views from its observation deck.

{% include figure image_path="/images/post_photos/june2023/22.JPG" alt="this is a placeholder image" caption="Korakuen Garden" %}

My journey then led me to Kurashiki, a captivating town that seemed like it was pulled straight from a historic painting. Wandering through the well-preserved Edo-period streets of the Bikan Historical Quarter, I felt transported back in time. Quaint white-walled merchant houses with black-tiled roofs lined the canal, creating a nostalgic and picturesque setting. The Ohara Museum of Art was another highlight, boasting an impressive collection of Western and Japanese artwork, including pieces by renowned artists like Monet and El Greco.

{% include figure image_path="/images/post_photos/june2023/23.JPG" alt="this is a placeholder image" caption="Kurashiki" %}

While Okayama impressed me with its fusion of history and nature, Kurashiki charmed me with its authenticity and cultural treasures. The blend of these two destinations made for a truly enriching experience that highlighted the diversity of Japan's offerings. In addition to the city itself, exploring Okayama brought forth delightful experiences in terms of their local delicacies. One of the highlights was indulging in the region's famed peaches. Okayama is also known as the "Peach Prefecture," and it offers some of the juiciest and most flavorful peaches I've ever tasted. Their sweetness and succulence were truly a treat for the senses, leaving an indelible impression of Okayama's agricultural abundance.

In addition, a particularly sentimental moment was visiting Notre Dame University in Okayama, where my mother once pursued her education. Walking around the campus felt like retracing her footsteps and connecting with her past (I couldn't step foot on the campus since it was an all women's school). The university's serene surroundings, characterized by lush greenery and a sense of academic camaraderie, gave me a glimpse into the environment that shaped my mother's university years. It was a meaningful experience to stand where she once stood, and it deepened my appreciation for the city's role in her life journey. Okayama became not just a destination, but a place imbued with personal history and significance.

# Yamaguchi

Next on the list was Yamaguchi. My journey to Yamaguchi was a captivating exploration of diverse cultural elements that define this region. This was again a city known for its onsens, where it was a serene escape from the everyday commute from city to city. The soothing waters and tranquil ambiance allowed me to unwind and experience the therapeutic benefits of this centuries-old tradition. Inside the city, one of the most charming aspects of Yamaguchi was its appreciation for foxes. These creatures are symbolic of the region, embodying qualities such as cleverness and mystique. Fox-related motifs were intricately woven into local art, craftwork, and cultural expressions, offering a unique lens into the place's folklore and traditions. Exploring Yamaguchi allowed me to connect with its rich history, indulge in its culinary treasures, and immerse myself in the unique elements that make this region truly special.

Yamaguchi is also known for one of the most unique foods I got to eat in Japan. Sampling puffer fish, or fugu, was a culinary adventure unlike any other. Known for its delicacy and potential risks, trying fugu required entrusting skilled chefs who masterfully prepare this unique dish. While the taste was a blend of excitement and exquisite flavor, the experience itself was a bit underwhelming due to its lack of flavor. In my mind, it seemed so exciting to eat a dish, where if not prepared carefully, I could die, but the experience itself was a little bland and somewhat did not meet my expecations. Regardless, I felt lucky to experience this japanese tradition in the place where its known to be the best.

### Akiyoshi-do

{% include figure image_path="/images/post_photos/june2023/26.JPG" alt="this is a placeholder image" caption="Akiyoshi-do's Entrance" %}

While I was in Yamaguchi, I also ventured off into the city of Mine to check out Akiyoshi-do. Visiting Akiyoshi-do, was an awe-inspiring adventure that took me into the heart of the Earth's mysterious beauty. As I ventured deep into the limestone cavern, I was surrounded by the intricate formations that nature had sculpted over millions of years. Stalactites hung delicately from the ceiling, and stalagmites rose majestically from the cave floor, creating a mesmerizing underground landscape. This experience was my first time in a cave, and it felt surreal to see one in real life aside from Minecraft...

{% include figure image_path="/images/post_photos/june2023/27.JPG" alt="this is a placeholder image" caption="Akiyoshi-do's Beautiful Structure" %}

The scale of Akiyoshi-do was truly astounding, with vast chambers and passages that seemed to stretch endlessly. I marveled at the stunning colors and textures of the rock formations, illuminated by the soft glow of carefully placed lights. The guided tour provided fascinating insights into the cave's geology and history, making the experience both educational and captivating. Exploring Akiyoshi-do was like entering a different world, far removed from the nature I see on an everyday basis. It was a humbling reminder of the Earth's remarkable ability to shape its own beauty, and I felt a sense of wonder and gratitude for having the opportunity to witness such a natural wonder. Akiyoshi-do left an indelible mark on my memory, reminding me of the hidden marvels that exist beneath the surface of our planet.

# Hakata, Fukuoka

At Last, we have made it to the famous Kyushu Prefecture which was one of the absolute highlights of my trip. My journey took me to the vibrant city of Hakata in Fukuoka, a place that seamlessly blends rich cultural heritage with modern urban charm. As I stepped into the bustling streets, the energy of the city enveloped me, promising an unforgettable experience.

One of the highlights of my time in Hakata was undoubtedly its exceptional culinary scene. The aroma of delicious dishes permeated the air, enticing me to explore the city's gastronomic delights. My taste buds were treated to an unforgettable journey as I savored the renowned Tonkotsu Ramen at the Yatai stalls along the famous canal. The rich and creamy pork bone broth, combined with the delicate yet chewy noodles, was a symphony of flavors that left an indelible mark on my palate. Venturing further into Hakata's culinary tapestry, I had the pleasure of indulging in Motsunabe, a hot pot dish featuring tender beef or pork offal and vegetables in a flavorful broth. The dish not only offered a unique and hearty taste but also provided a glimpse into Hakata's culinary traditions and its dedication to utilizing every ingredient to create a harmonious ensemble of flavors. And then there was torikawa, the crispy and savory chicken skin that perfectly encapsulated the essence of Hakata's street food culture. The bustling Yatai stalls lined along the canal were a treasure trove of culinary wonders, offering not only a chance to indulge in delectable treats but also to engage with local vendors who shared their passion for food and their city's heritage.

Hakata's culinary scene isn't just about the dishes themselves; it's about the experiences and connections they offer. From savoring Tonkotsu Ramen by the serene canal to relishing Motsunabe's communal dining experience, each bite told a story of Hakata's culinary heritage. My journey through the city's diverse and flavorful offerings left me with a profound appreciation for its gastronomic treasures and the passionate people who bring them to life.

### Boys Night

While in Hakata, I was fortunate enough to make some friends once again. Every day from 5:30-6:30 pm in our hotel, there was a special happy hour offering unlimited Lemon Sour cocktails or pints of beer. As we were in a lively nightlife district, many hotel guests would gather for this event. On the first night, I met a group of men who were on a holiday vacation, essentially enjoying a boys' trip. I struck up a conversation with one of them over a game of billiards, which led to an invitation to join them for drinks afterward. During this time, I got to know about their backgrounds, the purpose of their visit, and simply relished a night of drinking together. The four of them worked at the same company and hailed from Kumamoto. Despite the considerable age difference, it became evident that age was merely a number, and any group of people could easily connect and have a memorable night out.

Hakata, to me, felt like Japan's equivalent of Miami, Florida, offering a distinct social experience compared to other places I had visited. We began our evening at a highball bar, enjoying whiskey-based drinks mixed with soda. Subsequently, we ventured into a snack bar, one of the unique activities you can find in Japan. A snack bar is a cozy and intimate establishment where patrons can enjoy drinks, light bites, and engaging conversations with hosts or hostesses. It provides a distinct social experience, merging entertainment, hospitality, and companionship. The interactions between customers and staff members play a pivotal role, fostering camaraderie and laughter. While snack bars differentiate themselves from conventional bars or clubs, they represent a culturally significant way to socialize and connect with others in Japan.

At the snack bar, I even had the opportunity to sing karaoke with my new friends and strike up conversations with Sakura-chan, the friendly bartender. Overall, it was a delightful night out, spending time with this unique group. Most importantly, I cherished their warm hospitality, as they graciously took me under their wing and covered the expenses for the entire evening.

# Kumamoto

During my visit to Kumamoto, I was immediately struck by the city's vibrant atmosphere, thanks in part to its iconic landmarks and beloved mascot, Kumamon. The majestic Aso-san, a volcanic mountain range with the largest caldera in the world, dominated the landscape and offered breathtaking vistas that captured the essence of nature's grandeur. The city's deep connection to Aso-san was palpable, with opportunities to explore its lush surroundings, ancient temples, and hot springs that were truly a testament to the beauty of the region. On one of my days in Kumamoto, I had the opportunity to trek to Aso-san and climb to the caldera. Unfortunately, it wasn't as beautiful as I thought it would be, but it was still beautiful regardless. And while Aso-san didn't live to my expecatations, it was still an honor to be able visit the cities largest attraction. In highsight, I was also moments away from climbing Fuji-san, so it was a nice trial run to climb the less extreme volcano.

{% include figure image_path="/images/post_photos/june2023/32.JPG" alt="this is a placeholder image" caption="Aso" %}

Yet, amidst this natural splendor, the ever-present and adorable Kumamon character added a whimsical touch to the city's identity. This lovable bear mascot, with its round cheeks and friendly demeanor, seemed to pop up around every corner, charming both locals and visitors alike. Whether it was on billboards, merchandise, or in the hearts of the people, Kumamon was a delightful symbol of Kumamoto's warm and inviting spirit. Venturing through Kumamoto's streets, I encountered Kumamon's playful presence at every turn – from shopfronts to public spaces. The mascot's popularity extended beyond just appearances; it seemed to embody the community's sense of unity and pride. His presence could not be empasized enough, and it was almost as if he was the mayor of the town. It was lovely to be able to see one of my favorite japanese mascots in his origin city, and it was another aspect that I wanted to highlight apart of Japans culture. 

{% include figure image_path="/images/post_photos/june2023/33.JPG" alt="this is a placeholder image" caption="Kumamon" %}

Another quick stop we made from Kumamoto was venturing to Takachiho Gorge, which was a remarkable journey into Japan's cultural tapestry. As I stood before the breathtaking gorge, I felt the weight of its significance. The lush greenery and sheer cliffs exuded a sense of mystique, and I could understand why it was regarded as a sacred site in Japanese mythology. At this place you are able to row down the river, but unfortunately due to unforseen weather conditions, I was unable to partake in this boat adventure. Yet even then I felt a deep connection to the stories and legends that had been passed down through generations just by being at this beautiful nature site. In this mini trip, I also was able to try nagashi somen – a unique dining experience where somen noodles are sent flowing down bamboo shoots, and diners catch them with chopsticks. The playful and interactive nature of the meal was a delight, and I couldn't help but laugh as I attempted to capture the slippery noodles. This experience not only satisfied my taste buds but also offered a glimpse into the communal spirit and fun-loving essence of Japanese culture. Takachiho Gorge left an indelible mark on me, weaving together natural beauty and cultural immersion in a way that felt truly enchanting.

During my time in Kumamoto, I also embarked on a culinary adventure that was both intriguing and slightly unconventional – trying basashi, or horse sashimi. This local delicacy held a unique place in Kumamoto's gastronomic scene, and I was determined to embrace the experience. As the plate arrived before me, showcasing thinly sliced pieces of horse meat, I couldn't help but feel a mixture of curiosity and apprehension. With a delicate texture and a slightly sweet flavor, basashi was unlike anything I had tasted before. The initial oddness of consuming horse meat quickly gave way to an appreciation for the local culture and their culinary traditions. This dining experience was by far one of the weirdest ones, where I would rank this in my top 3 of all time weird foods that I have tried. But again it was delicious and Kumamoto proved to be worth the trip down south.

# Kagoshima

The most southern point I hit on the trip and the last primary stop of my trek was in Kagoshima. Kagoshima is most southern city in the Kyushu prefecture brimming with unique attractions and a distinct charm. One of the most captivating sights was the majestic Sakurajima volcano, an active presence that seemed to watch over the city. Rumor had it that there were occasional plumes of smoke rising from its peak where it would often rain ash across the city which was a reminder of the powerful forces of nature at play. Exploring Kagoshima's streets, I was greeted by a vibrant mix of modern architecture and historical landmarks, creating a seamless blend of old and new. However, I would not be here long as I would make my way towards yet another volcanic experience.

{% include figure image_path="/images/post_photos/june2023/37.JPG" alt="this is a placeholder image" caption="Sakurajima" %}

One of the most intriguing experiences I had in Kagoshima was visiting Ibusuki to try the famous Sunamushi onsen (Volcanic Sand Onsen). The concept of immersing oneself in naturally heated sand felt both exotic and fascinating. As I lay down on the beach and was gently covered in warm volcanic sand, the sensation was unlike anything I had ever experienced. The soothing warmth penetrated my muscles, creating a relaxing and rejuvenating effect. It was an extraordinary feeling, and as I enjoyed the sun-dappled coastline and listened to the gentle waves, I couldn't help but appreciate the sheer uniqueness of this traditional practice. Kagoshima offered me a glimpse into a different side of Japan – a place where natural wonders and cultural experiences converged to create unforgettable memories. The city's diverse offerings, from its striking landscapes to its traditional practices, left me with a deep appreciation for the intricacies and beauty that define this incredible region.

# Hello Kitty Shinkansen

Riding the Hello Kitty Shinkansen from Hakata Station to Shin-Osaka was an unforgettable experience that added a whimsical touch to my journey through Japan. What made this ride particularly special is that the Hello Kitty Shinkansen operates only once a day, which made it feel like a rare and exclusive treat for tourists like me. As the train pulled into the station, its vibrant pink and white exterior adorned with Hello Kitty motifs instantly brought a smile to my face. 

{% include figure image_path="/images/post_photos/june2023/38.JPG" alt="this is a placeholder image" caption="Hello Kitty Shinkansen" %}

Stepping inside, I was greeted by a charming Hello Kitty-themed interior that extended from the seats and windows to the adorable details on the headrests and curtains. Even the onboard announcements featured the iconic character's cheerful voice. It was clear that every element of this train was designed with meticulous attention to detail. As the Hello Kitty Shinkansen glided through the picturesque Japanese countryside, I couldn't help but marvel at the blending of tradition and pop culture. This unique train ride encapsulated Japan's knack for seamlessly fusing the old and the new, making it a memorable and heartwarming experience for tourists like me who were fortunate enough to embark on this special journey. It was a delightful reminder of the country's ability to surprise and delight travelers at every turn.

# Kyoto & Osaka

The final two stops on the trip were in Kyoto and Osaka. Kyoto, a city steeped in history and culture, left an indelible mark on my heart during my visit. Kiyomizu-dera, perched on a hillside, was an enchanting temple that offered breathtaking panoramic views of Kyoto. Walking along the wooden terrace, I marveled at the lush greenery below and the city's rooftops stretching out in the distance. The temple's famous wooden stage, seemingly suspended in mid-air, added an element of wonder to the experience. Exploring the temple's halls and pagodas, I soaked in the serene atmosphere and learned about its deep Buddhist roots.

Arashiyama Bamboo Grove was another highlight of my Kyoto journey. As I ventured into this natural wonderland, I was surrounded by towering bamboo stalks that swayed gently in the breeze. The sound of the rustling leaves created a soothing melody, and I felt a profound sense of tranquility. The iconic pathway led me through the heart of the grove, and I couldn't help but marvel at the sheer beauty of this unique bamboo forest. Nearby, the Togetsukyo Bridge provided a picturesque vantage point to admire the Arashiyama district's scenic beauty.

Fushimi Inari Taisha, with its thousands of vibrant red torii gates, was a spiritual and visual marvel. As I ascended the mountain, passing under these crimson arches, I was captivated by the sense of reverence that enveloped the place. Each gate symbolized a donation from individuals or businesses, a testament to the deep devotion to Inari, the Shinto god of rice and prosperity. The hike to the summit was both invigorating and humbling, offering stunning views of Kyoto along the way. It was a pilgrimage through natural beauty and spirituality that left an enduring impression on my soul. Kyoto's rich tapestry of history, nature, and spirituality had woven unforgettable memories into my travelogue.

On the other hand, my visit to Osaka was a culinary adventure, with Dotonbori being the epicenter of gastronomic delights. As I strolled through the bustling streets of this vibrant district, the enticing aroma of street food beckoned me. My first stop was at a street vendor where I indulged in takoyaki, those delightful octopus-filled balls of goodness. Watching the skilled chef deftly pour the batter into the sizzling molds and expertly flip the takoyaki was a mesmerizing experience. Topped with savory sauce, bonito flakes, and a sprinkle of seaweed, each bite was a burst of umami flavors that left me craving for more.

Continuing my culinary exploration, I found a cozy Okonomiyaki restaurant tucked away in a narrow alley. Here, I had the pleasure of watching the chef prepare this savory pancake right before my eyes. The sizzle of the batter, the sizzling of various ingredients, and the tantalizing aroma filled the air. The finished Okonomiyaki, topped with a drizzle of sweet sauce and a generous helping of mayonnaise, was a delightful fusion of textures and flavors. Dining at this local eatery was a true immersion into Osaka's food culture.

To cap off my culinary adventure in Dotonbori, I couldn't resist trying golden ice cream at a charming café I stumbled upon. The ice cream, adorned with a sheet of edible gold leaf, was as decadent as it looked. Each spoonful of creamy indulgence, with the subtle hint of gold, was a sweet and luxurious treat. It was the perfect ending to my gastronomic journey through Osaka's bustling and flavorful heart, Dotonbori.

### Grandparents

The last portion of the trip entailed of spending some long-awaited time with my grandparents. It is always nice to see my extended family from time to time because we appreciate each others company more than anything. Also since I was visiting them, they always go all out to make sure I have a plenty good experience in Japan. Therefore in brief, one of the highlights from spending time with my grandparents was our little trip to Izushi. Visiting the picturesque city of Izushi with my grandparents and mom was a heartwarming family adventure. Nestled in the serene Hyogo Prefecture, Izushi is renowned for its well-preserved Edo-period streets and, of course, its delectable soba noodles. One of the highlights of our trip was taking on the famous "soba challenge" at a quaint local eatery.

The soba challenge was not for the faint of heart. The goal was to consume as many plates of these delicious buckwheat noodles as possible. The goal of the challenge was to eat 20 plates of soba and it was undoubtedley an irresistible feast. The challenge began, and we voraciously slurped plate after plate. The flavors were exquisite, and the texture of the soba was impeccable. To my surprise and everyone else's amusement, I managed to devour an astonishing 23 plates of soba. It was a gastronomic triumph that left me both proud and pleasantly stuffed.

After our soba conquest, we decided to unwind and relax at a nearby onsen, taking advantage of the soothing hot springs that this region is known for. The onsen experience was a perfect way to rejuvenate after our hearty meal. Surrounded by the tranquil Japanese countryside, we soaked in the healing waters, letting go of all our stresses and worries. It was a moment of serenity and connection with both nature and family. Izushi, with its rich culinary heritage and therapeutic onsen, provided a beautiful backdrop for our family getaway, creating memories that we would cherish for years to come.

Outside of Izushi, another highlight was just being able to drink alcohol with my grandparents. I think its fair to say that it must be every grandparents dream to live long enough to enjoy the day where you and your grandchildren can enjoy drinks together. We did this everyday during my short stay together, and I was also able to treat my grandparents to a dinner after years of them supporting me and my dreams. 

As I reflect on my journey through Japan, I'm overwhelmed with gratitude for the incredible experiences I've had and the wonderful people I've met along the way. Exploring this beautiful country, from the serene temples of Kyoto to the bustling streets of Tokyo, has been nothing short of a dream come true. Japan's rich culture, stunning landscapes, and mouthwatering cuisine have left an indelible mark on my heart.

Looking ahead, I can't contain my excitement for what the next month holds. Climbing the iconic Mount Fuji, with its breathtaking vistas and spiritual significance, promises to be a challenging yet immensely rewarding adventure. I eagerly anticipate the opportunity to push my limits and reach the summit, taking in the awe-inspiring sunrise from the "Roof of Japan."

As my Japan odyssey enters its final stretch, I'm brimming with anticipation for the adventures that await. I'll carry the memories of this remarkable journey with me always, cherishing the friendships made and the lessons learned. With the majestic Mount Fuji on the horizon and the vibrant streets of Tokyo before me, I'm ready to embrace the next chapter of this unforgettable adventure.
