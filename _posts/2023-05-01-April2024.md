# Top Three Highlights of the Month


### 1. Joshua Tree


### 2. Yoasobi


### 3. MLHC

In March, my research project was brutally disected from a set of computer science researchers and it felt bad to get my first project rejected by the ICML community. However I only got a few days to sulk and it was back to work for me. Therefore I was able to re-turn in our work for 

# One thing I learned this Month

## Time goes by fast when you're having fun but also when you're not

I think one of the most amazing things I have witnessed recently is that time is a constant force. As the summer slowly approaches, for once in my time as a graduate student I wish it would stop. Being a graduate student has come with so much more responsibility and I feel like I've overextended myself to do way too many things. My current experience with how I feel compares to the friends I made in the East coast last year where they quite literally had no free time. I didn't quite understand why they did that back then but in just a year I had converted to their ways. However it is truly fascinating how time just keeps moving even if you aren't having the best of times. The fact that my first year is coming to an end soon is jaw-dropping and I am in awe that its going by so fast. However it is only problematic for me because as time progresses that means there are new deadlines and events approaching. For one we have our first year written qualification exam scheduled in August, and it scares me that in just about 4 months now that we will be asked to take those. At the current state I do not feel adequately prepared whatsoever and am scared of failing. Therefore sometimes I wish time would just slow down. While life has been extremely busy and not totally fun, I think there is a side to my life where it is really fun and exciting socially. The contrast has been the tale of two sides and I have come to accept that this is my current reality for the next few years.
