This past week, I spent some time traveling to Miami & Orlando Florida. During this time, I had one moment from the trip that really inspired today's blog post. Since there were not many ideas for other topics, I thought today I would share two anecdotes from my personal life that can probably teach everyone reading a lesson. A parable if you will. I think from the 21 years I have lived so far, I have realized that life is not fair, and it can be a cruel place sometimes. However I firmly believe that the way you interact and present yourself to others is what makes our world a beautiful place. Unfortunately kindness, people who will listen and are open to perspectives are truly a rarity in what I have found to be somewhat of a contentious environment. So I hope today's blog post reminds everyone to treat people the way you want to be treated.

# The Cost of Kindness


On my way out of Miami, I was on an uber heading towards Fort Lauderdale Airport which was roughly a 40 minute car ride from where I was staying. In the middle of this uber ride, I checked my email like any other normal day in my life. When the refresh had completed, I had noticed I had gotten an email from the airlines I was about to depart with. After clicking on the email, I was disappointed to say the least that my flight had been canceled. This was very problematic because I had to get to Orlando somehow as I would be departing from there to get back home to Boston. Another small dilemma I had was whether to tell my uber driver to stop driving me away from Miami itself. I decided to say nothing and tried to plan the next course of action first by checking all available flights that depart within 6 hours from the time. I had found one quickly but it came at a hefty sum, as buying a plane ticket the day of usually is upcharged compared to planning ahead. The night before I had already gotten poor sleep because I had to wake up early for this flight so I was a little flared up which I thought was a natural reaction. When I had arrived at Fort Lauderdale, I called the next uber to the Miami International Airport which would be roughly an hour from where I was then. Since it was an hour out, the uber itself was also very pricey and this was slowly beginning to turn into a bad day.


When I got into my uber, I was greeted by a kind man named Hugo. I was wearing a Miami Heat Basketball shirt that I had bought the night before and he had commented about my shirt which began a conversation about basketball. Hugo was very friendly and reminded me of who I strive to be, which is a super smiley happy person. After concluding our conversation about Julius Randle's game winner, I had told him that my flight had been canceled at Fort Lauderdale and told him why I was now heading to the other airport. Though he had zero involvement in my situation, he felt very remorseful and told me he would try to change the day. I had not had breakfast that morning and he offered to show me around Miami to go get some breakfast at no extra cost. At first I was hesitant because Uber automatically changes the fare based on the driver's route but it is very hard for me to ever turn down an opportunity and I am so glad I did not turn this opportunity down. I told him a little about my story, how I was currently residing in Boston, working in biotech, graduated early, seeing the world, and he made me feel that all my decisions were the right ones by telling me I was "living the dream".


Oftentimes in life, we are presented with two diverging roads with choice A and B and once we pursue a choice/scenario, it totally changes the direction of our lives. However, being so young, while I tell myself I have no regrets, deep inside I sometimes stumble on some of the decisions I have made and ask myself if they were all worth it. So to hear Hugo tell me I was "living the dream" felt great in many ways. Someone with no technical bias, being a stranger, had told me that my life was pretty much cool. After sharing some of my background, I also heard about his background in which he told me about his academics, children, extended family, brother who is a professor at Northeastern, etc. The two of us got along very well as we got closer to downtown Miami. Once in Miami he started giving me a tour as a local and showed me around some of the places I had passed by on foot but never truly knew what everything was. We went through Brickell which is like the Wall Street of Miami with business men & pretty women, and slowly made our way to little Havana where we would later on have a Colombian Breakfast.


In Little Havana, he took me to a local Columbian restaurant where he actually bought me Empanadas & Pandebono (Colombian Cheese bread). He also ordered me a cafe con leche (coffee with milk), and scrambled huevos/cayeye/cornbread/calentado. Columbia is known to have good coffee and I do have to say that it was some of the best coffee I had ever had. Below I have pictured some of the breakfast (I forgot to picture the main course >:( ):

During breakfast I asked him if he does this with all his uber clients and he told me... "No". I was actually quite astonished because it showed that he really went out of his way to try and make my day better. And he told me his version of the golden rule: treat others the way you want to be treated. He told me that what he puts in now through the kindness of his heart will repay him in the future. I usually am rarely awed by strangers but the kind gesture truly transformed the events of my day. And I told him that if my flight didn't get canceled, I would have never met him and that I am now happy that it did get canceled. But thanks to Hugo, I was reminded that within the ugliness of the world, there is some light. Therefore at least for me, this experience really touched me and I want to treat everyone with kindness and continue to just be a good person to this world.

# My First Listener

This second anecdote is really inspired by my interaction with Hugo, and this dates back way back to high school. During that time I was in a weird place. I had been rejected by nearly all colleges at that time, I had my heart crushed by my high school crush, and there was a high degree of anxiety and pressure about what was to come next in my future. Being a teenager nowadays has become more difficult due to the terrible environment and resources that came from high school. For example, although we were in a nice suburb, drugs/smoking was a huge issue, along with social media presence which was a toxic environment to be a part of when you are still trying to figure out all the confusing things about being a teen. But in my senior year, I was really stressed. I was close minded, didn't know what I wanted to study, wasn't expecting to be rejected by all the colleges up to that point and felt like my work was all for nothing. One day during my US government class, I sent an email to my counselor Naseem Saremi who I had known from being a board member of site council which was an exclusive group of students, teachers, faculty, and parents to discuss things related to school finances/culture. At the time I just asked her if I could come by to her office to go talk to her and I was happy to have received an answer from her welcoming me into her office anytime.


Therefore in that first meeting, she stopped all that she was doing just to listen to me. I had good friends & family that I knew I could talk to but sharing that vulnerability to them felt uncomfortable to me at the time. So the role Naseem played in my life truly is one of the foundational pillars as to why I am the way I am. For once in my life at the time, I had found someone who would never tell me if I was right or wrong, what I should do, but would just listen to all my teenage problems. Whether it was about the stress of college, the girls I liked, or just feeling a little lost, she would just sit there and listen to me. Though I don't like the idea of having a "therapist", she was somewhat of that type of figure in my life. She provided stability in a chaotic world and I think I took a lot of how I composed myself from her. And though she wouldn't compare my situations to hers, she told me similar stories of struggle and hardship, which really taught me how to be a better person.


Therefore from there on in my senior year, I literally stopped going to all the non-mandatory government classes, to just go sit in her office and talk to her. It was the part of the day that I could vent without being judged by my friends, and let the weight off of my chest. I had many excused absences my senior year of high school, but reflecting on my values as a person, it led me back to this lost archive memory that I had nearly forgotten.

I truly owe her a proper thank you for being a foundational person in my life that was outside of my friends and family. Though we worked at the time professionally on important decision making of our high school, the fact that she could bring me peace was something I admired so much. And no matter how small my accomplishments were at the time, she made sure to celebrate them. I am saddened that she no longer works at Northgate High School because she is among one of the few people I'd like to speak to once more before I prepare myself for the next part of my journey. But overall from the blog this week, I wanted to showcase that there are positives among the many negatives associated with the climate of the world. These two individuals truly inspire me to be a good person and I hope my writing conveyed a sentiment that you can also absorb. Thanks for reading!
