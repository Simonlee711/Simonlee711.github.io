In this weeks blog post I wanted to talk about the brand new trainined Aritificial Intellegience System **chatGPT**. I have been modestly following this brand new system released by the *OpenAI* team via Twitter, but the more research I do on it, the more astonished I become by the capabilities of this bot. To put it into simple terms, it is probably the first functional cognitive artificial brain that we have seen created by man. With its ability to correct itself and remember previous prompts, I see no difference between this bot and a normal human being. It has been trending all over the AI community for various reasons and I wanted to spend a few minutes talking about some of its capabilites and what this means for the future of AI.

Before diving into some of the things chatGPT is able to do, we should define loosely who, what, and why
