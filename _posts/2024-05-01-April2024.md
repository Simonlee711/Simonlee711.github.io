April marked a fresh start as I began the last quarter of my first year in the Ph.D. program‚Äîan astounding thought, given how swiftly the time has passed. It feels as though I might earn my degree sooner than expected. This month was eventful and bustling as usual, filled with both good and bad chaos, yet still moving in the right direction.

While some experiences might not make it into my top three highlights, one memorable outing was attending a Clippers playoff game with my friend Tim, where we saw some of LA's famous stars. Another new venture I haven't previously mentioned is my food Instagram account, through which I've been exploring the diverse eateries across Los Angeles. A particularly exciting find was a Hakata-style izakaya near UCLA, where I enjoyed Motsunabe‚Äîone of my favorite soups. Overall, it was a truly great month.

# Top Three Highlights of the Month

### 1. Joshua Tree

This month I was able to take a small trip with my girlfriend to Joshua Tree national park. For being really close to it, I have never made the initiative to plan out a trip to go to this national park. However I had seen so many pictures and heard great things, so I thought taking this trip would be a nice little break in the Ph.D. chaos. We therefore were trying to be proactive and left at 3pm but didn't arrive until nearly 9pm due to LA traffic...

Nonetheless it was quite the nice escape, and a breath of fresh air from the chaos that is Los Angeles. When we arrived to Joshua Tree, it had felt like we were in the midwest or something. That drive and this trip really reminded me that the world is really an empty place and that people are condensed into these small cities. When we had arrived it was weirdly windy but we ignored the chilly dessert night and took a plunge in the hottub.

### 2. Yoasobi

In April, one of the highlights was attending Yoasobi's first-ever solo concert in the USA. I had the good fortune to see them last summer at the Head in the Clouds festival, which marked their debut performance in the USA. Yoasobi, like all concerts, never disappoints. Although buying tickets might not always be the best financial decision, the awe-inspiring experience always justifies the expense. This concert offered a longer, 1-hour and 30-minute performance compared to the 40-minute set at Head in the Clouds.

Another exciting feature of the concert was a 3D interactive component. Attendees were given 3D glasses, and 3-4 songs featured visuals in 3D‚Äîa simple yet innovative idea that was a first for me to see from pop artists. One unique aspect of concerts by Japanese artists is that they typically do not have openers. As a result, I waited from 6 PM to 9 PM in silence just to secure a good spot. Nonetheless, the wait was well worth it, as the concert was fantastic.

### 3. MLHC

In March, my research project was brutally disected from a set of computer science researchers and it felt bad to get my first project rejected by the ICML community. However I only got a few days to sulk and it was back to work for me. Therefore I was able to re-turn in our work for a confernce this summer in Toronto. In general, I've come to realize that harsh rejections are a good and humbling thing. I think sometimes when we have continued success, we need to be brought back to earth and this was the case for me. While I am saddened to not be able to get accepted into the international confernece of machine learning this time around, there is always next year and the next 3 after that lol. I hope this next one goes well with our improvements and hopefully I'll be in Toronto this summer!

# One thing I learned this Month

## Time goes by fast when you're having fun but also when you're not

I think one of the most amazing things I have witnessed recently is that time is a constant force. As the summer slowly approaches, for once in my time as a graduate student I wish it would stop. Being a graduate student has come with so much more responsibility and I feel like I've overextended myself to do way too many things. My current experience with how I feel compares to the friends I made in the East coast last year where they quite literally had no free time. I didn't quite understand why they did that back then but in just a year I had converted to their ways. However it is truly fascinating how time just keeps moving even if you aren't having the best of times. The fact that my first year is coming to an end soon is jaw-dropping and I am in awe that its going by so fast. However it is only problematic for me because as time progresses that means there are new deadlines and events approaching. For one we have our first year written qualification exam scheduled in August, and it scares me that in just about 4 months now that we will be asked to take those. At the current state I do not feel adequately prepared whatsoever and am scared of failing. Therefore sometimes I wish time would just slow down. While life has been extremely busy and not totally fun, I think there is a side to my life where it is really fun and exciting socially. The contrast has been the tale of two sides and I have come to accept that this is my current reality for the next few years.
