This month marks my #thereturn, a moment filled with nostalgia, connection, and the acknowledgment of the passage of time. Returning to Los Angeles, a city that holds both fond and challenging memories, carries a new purpose this time around. Back in February 2023, when I shared my acceptance into a Ph.D. program, I contemplated the possibility of returning to the City of Angels. Now, in September, I find myself embarking on this new chapter in Los Angeles once more.

This shift represents yet another twist in what has been a dynamic chapter in my life, one I eagerly embrace. During my previous work experiences, I realized the importance of finding a niche that aligns with my passions and values, a career I could sustainably love for decades. The idea of spending the next 40+ years doing something I'm not entirely passionate about felt daunting. Hence, the pursuit of a Ph.D. felt not only necessary but exhilarating.

Ph.D. programs are renowned for their challenges, and I believe these trials and tribulations are essential for personal growth. While many Ph.D. journeys lead to becoming a scientist, what truly draws me to this advanced degree is the emphasis on innovation. Novel approaches are paramount in a field where success hinges on publishing groundbreaking work. I aim to test my creativity in the realm of methods development and face the challenges with determination.

Beyond academia, I'm excited to embrace life as a young adult in Los Angeles, a city teeming with possibilities and endless stimulation. While I won't delve into details here, Los Angeles offers a vibrant array of activities and experiences unmatched by many other places. Thus, I eagerly anticipate navigating life in LA and discovering more about myself during my formative years.

In the coming years, I foresee a multitude of challenges and personal growth as I work towards my career objectives. This period, marked by its lengthened stay in Los Angeles, will enable me to adapt to my surroundings and provide me with experiences I may have missed during my year of constant travel. Each month, I will continue to share my lessons and relish the journey for what it is.

In summary, September heralds another transformative chapter in my life. I eagerly anticipate my time in Los Angeles and am excited to witness the personal and professional growth that will undoubtedly accompany this unique experience.
