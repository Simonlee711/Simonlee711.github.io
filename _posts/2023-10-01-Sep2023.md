This month features my #thereturn moment. Reunions hold a special place in the tapestry of human experience, weaving threads of nostalgia, connection, and the passage of time into a single, memorable moment. In my case, I have moved back to Los Angeles, where I have shared many good and bad memories. But this time I return for a totally different reason. When I first reported back in February 2023 that I had been admitted into a Ph.D., I had deep thoughts about the possibility to return to the city of angels. And now that we are in the month of September, I am starting my twighlight episode in the city of Los Angeles once more. 

Truthfully Los Angeles is a lovely city, but after this tenure here, it is probably my last of staying in this city. While there is so much to do and many things I like, I think I seek yet another journey to a city I've loved since I was a high schooler. However until then, staying here for yet another extended period of time is an opportunity to embrace literally everything I want to. Therefore
