This month marks my #thereturn, a moment filled with nostalgia, connection, and the acknowledgment of the passage of time. Returning to Los Angeles, a city that holds both fond and challenging memories, carries a new purpose this time around. Back in February 2023, when I shared my acceptance into a Ph.D. program, I contemplated the possibility of returning to the City of Angels. Now, in September, I find myself embarking on this new chapter in Los Angeles once more.

This shift represents yet another twist in what has been a dynamic chapter in my life, one I eagerly embrace. During my previous work experiences, I realized the importance of finding a niche that aligns with my passions and values, a career I could sustainably love for decades. The idea of spending the next 40+ years doing something I'm not entirely passionate about felt daunting. Hence, the pursuit of a Ph.D. felt not only necessary but exhilarating.

Ph.D. programs are renowned for their challenges, and I believe these trials and tribulations are essential for personal growth. While many Ph.D. journeys lead to becoming a scientist, what truly draws me to this advanced degree is the emphasis on innovation. Novel approaches are paramount in a field where success hinges on publishing groundbreaking work. I aim to test my creativity in the realm of methods development and face the challenges with determination.

Beyond academia, I'm excited to embrace life as a young adult in Los Angeles, a city teeming with possibilities and endless stimulation. While I won't delve into details here, Los Angeles offers a vibrant array of activities and experiences unmatched by many other places. Thus, I eagerly anticipate navigating life in LA and discovering more about myself during my formative years.

In the coming years, I foresee a multitude of challenges and personal growth as I work towards my career objectives. This period, marked by its lengthened stay in Los Angeles, will enable me to adapt to my surroundings and provide me with experiences I may have missed during my year of constant travel. Each month, I will continue to share my lessons and relish the journey for what it is.

In summary, September heralds another transformative chapter in my life. I eagerly anticipate my time in Los Angeles and am excited to witness the personal and professional growth that will undoubtedly accompany this unique experience.

# Top Three Highlights of the Month

### 1. Back in The City of Stars

"We are so back." It's a phrase that seems to echo through the conversations of young people today, and it perfectly encapsulates my return to the vibrant city of Los Angeles. Los Angeles, I've come to realize, is the quintessential city for the young and the adventurous. It's a place where boredom becomes an alien concept because there's always something to do, something to see, and something new to explore. As I embark on this fresh journey, I'm reminded of the clean slate that awaits, ready to be filled with new experiences.

Over the past year, it feels like I've hit the restart button in various unfamiliar places. But here I am, back at square one, surrounded by some familiar faces that bring a comforting sense of continuity. This return to an academic environment has rekindled a sense of excitement within me. After speed running through college, I didn't find the satisfaction I had expected in the industry. Now, I revel in the company of peers my age. In just this short month of September, I've already crossed paths with numerous new faces, reminding me of the ease of making connections in such an environment.

I find myself fortunate to be situated in a remarkable part of Los Angeles, graced with excellent weather and accessibility to a myriad of exciting areas. UCLA's Westwood location is essentially nestled in the heart of Beverly Hills and Bel Air, with West Hollywood and Santa Monica practically next door. Westwood itself is a unique bubble in the sprawling city, offering an exceptional place to grow and thrive.

My initial love affair with this city dates back to the moment I watched the Academy Award-winning film "La La Land," where the portrayal of Los Angeles left an indelible impression. The movie's powerful message about chasing dreams struck a chord within me, making it one of my all-time favorites. Inspired by this, I've taken the film's message to heart, embarking on a journey to discover and pursue my own dreams. Los Angeles is a hub for dreamers like me, a place where ambitions come to life, making it an ideal environment for personal growth and self-realization. This is where they derive the name "the city of stars".

While I am excited to be living in Los Angeles once more, it is also fair for me to say that this will be my last stint in this city. It is most definitely not a place I want to raise a family, and I seek out a new adventure out east real soon. From my time in Boston, I've come to realize that seasons were sort of beautiful in its own right and while I love the California Sun, it isn't what I exactly want forever. Therefore this last stint makes this experience ever more special because it will indeed be my last hoorah.

As I dive headfirst into this new chapter in Los Angeles, my excitement knows no bounds. I eagerly anticipate the adventures and discoveries that await, and I'm thrilled to continue sharing the myriad experiences of this incredible journey with all of you.
