I wanted to begin by noting that there will be a slight modification in style with these blogs moving forward. I love writing and have enjoyed this blog project, but when I encounter writer's block or simply lack the time, it becomes challenging to continue writing the long stories I wish to tell. Oftentimes, I also write the blogs well past the date I claim they were written, which means I have to remember the nitty-gritty details for a longer period. So, to preserve my limited memory, which I will need for school, some changes will need to be made. Therefore, due to academic challenges and my new life as a Ph.D. student, I think it's better to write shorter blogs that are of higher quality. Usually, the quality is quite good, as I have a free editor in ChatGPT who keeps my writing polished. I hope you understand... Now, back to the original topic.

November is the month of being thankful, and I have many reasons to be thankful this year. But before delving into why I am thankful, a quick note about Novemberâ€”it's a time of noticeable change. As the days grow shorter, casting long shadows early in the evening, there's a tangible shift in the rhythm of life. This is especially true in academia. For me, in graduate school, November marks a time when studies intensify, blending the theoretical aspects learned in the early quarter with more complex, practical applications. Assignments become more demanding, research more intricate, and expectations higher. Yet, amidst this academic crescendo, I find myself now fully in control of the graduate school routine. I've adapted to the pace, embraced the challenges, and honed my time management skills to a fine art. This mastery over my schedule and responsibilities, despite the shorter days and longer nights, is a significant reason for my gratitude this November.

Now, this blog again marks the iteration of a new era. For the past 15 or so blogs, we have maintained the structure of the *Top Three Highlights of the Month*, which I would usually touch on in the next section after my brief introduction. However, in the spirit of Thanksgiving and November, we are changing just for this month to *The Three Reasons to Be Thankful*.
