November is the month of being thankful. And I have all the reasons to be thankful this year. But before delving into why I am thankful, a quick note about the month of Novemberâ€”it's a period of noticeable change. As the days grow shorter, casting long shadows early in the evening, there's a tangible shift in the rhythm of life. This is especially true in the realm of academics. For me, in graduate school, November marks a time when studies intensify, where the theoretical aspects I learned in the early quarter start weaving into more complex, practical applications. Assignments become more demanding, research more intricate, and expectations higher. Yet, amidst this academic crescendo, I find myself now in full control of the graduate school routine. I've adapted to the pace, embraced the challenges, and honed my time management skills to a fine art. This mastery over my schedule and responsibilities, despite the shorter days and longer nights, is a significant reason for my gratitude this November.
