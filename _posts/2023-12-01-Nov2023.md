I wanted to begin by noting that there will be a slight modification in style with these blogs moving forward. I love writing and have enjoyed this blog project, but when I encounter writer's block or simply lack the time, it becomes challenging to continue writing the long stories I wish to tell. Oftentimes, I also write the blogs well past the date I claim they were written, which means I have to remember the nitty-gritty details for a longer period. So, to preserve my limited memory, which I will need for school, some changes will need to be made. Therefore, due to academic challenges and my new life as a Ph.D. student, I think it's better to write shorter blogs that are of higher quality. Usually, the quality is quite good, as I have a free editor in ChatGPT who keeps my writing polished. I hope you understand... Now, back to the original topic.

November is the month of being thankful, and I have many reasons to be thankful this year. But before delving into why I am thankful, a quick note about Novemberâ€”it's a time of noticeable change. As the days grow shorter, casting long shadows early in the evening, there's a tangible shift in the rhythm of life. This is especially true in academia. For me, in graduate school, November marks a time when studies intensify, blending the theoretical aspects learned in the early quarter with more complex, practical applications. Assignments become more demanding, research more intricate, and expectations higher. Yet, amidst this academic crescendo, I find myself now fully in control of the graduate school routine. I've adapted to the pace, embraced the challenges, and honed my time management skills to a fine art. This mastery over my schedule and responsibilities, despite the shorter days and longer nights, is a significant reason for my gratitude this November.

Now, this blog again marks the iteration of a new era. For the past 15 or so blogs, we have maintained the structure of the *Top Three Highlights of the Month*, which I would usually touch on in the next section after my brief introduction. However, in the spirit of Thanksgiving and November, we are changing just for this month to *The Three Reasons to Be Thankful*.

# Top Three Reasons to Be Thankful (2023 Edition)

### 1. All Around the World

2023 started off horribly. I left Switzerland because it was too much. My ex-girlfriend from the previous summer didn't want to see me and I wondered what my future awaited me. Confused and lonely, I would just walk around the streets in New York City wondering if things would go my way. This somber start to the year was not reflective of my year at all as it would soon turn out to be quite amazing. 

I started the year off traveling to Hamburg to spend time with Philippa in her native country, before being stranded in Instanbul's airport which was beautiful but hellish. After being stuck in the airport for nearly 22 hours I made it to my new home of Boston Massachusettes where I would be living for the futurue. I learned many things on the job from my manager Mukund, Fred, Greg, and even from my scarier workers Noah and Nico. Khoi and Laura were also very helpful during my time at Celcius always inviting me out for drinks when I felt out of place. Outside of my new work, I had met Lauren who invited me out all the time all around Boston where unsuccessful lovers became really good friends. She took me to museums, restaurants, bars and clubs and it was nice to have the first person you meet to be a really amazing friend. While adjusting to Boston's cold weather was quite difficult, nothing would ever be as bad as the day it was -8 degrees outside and I decided to walk 30 minutes to work. At some point I got fed up with the cold that I began traveling around the world where I would rekindle with old friends. 

It began with visiting Miami Florida, a legnedary city which lived up to every word ever spoken, and then stopping by Orlando and playing top golf with Tiffanie. Soon after I would go on to visit Ali in Toronto where we got to explore the 6ix, go to the top of CN Tower, and take a bus tour to the niagra falls and go maple syrup testing. Upon returning and working some more, it was time to go again where I road tripped with Osagie from northern California to southern California hitting all the stops from SF-LA/SD. After escaping the winter from all this traveling I began my extravagent dating life where I would not just go to meet a potential partner but also just look for FRIENDS. I can announce that I was successful in making friends where I would get a point of contact with many people from the hundreds of universities centered in Boston. From Harvard, MIT, Northeastern, Tufts, BU, and the list goes on and on, there was a plethora of opportunity for me to meet and greet many new friends. 

At some point, I found a bigger role at Harvard when I met Camilla due to helping her with a school project. This led to a sequence of events into the "luxury club" like experience that Harvard really was. I danced at socials, attended concerts, and went to a lot of their spring formals (college proms). It was all fun and to end they recruited me to go to Japan with them in June. So once June hit I travled to Japan, clubbed with them but ultimately traveled from Tokyo and all the way down to the bottom of the connected Island. I saw caves, waterfalls, volcanoes, and all types of beautiful terrain and I felt really lucky to explore the whole country. To conclude the trip I went and climbed Mt. Fuji seeing the view from the top of the world. However there are many other worlds that I'd like to see from above so climbing them are future mission. After leaving Japan I trecked over to Taiwan and met a local Joanna who was a sweet sweet girl with good fun energy. She took me to Din Tai Fung, took me to the top of taipei 101 and bought me a drink at the bar ;)

Once coming back home from my trip, I saw the end of a company and everyone was going to lose their job. Though it was a tough time to see everyone lose their job, it took them no time to recover. However losing my job meant I had to go home so it was farewell Boston and hello SF/WC. Living at home before moving to graduate school was a nice change of pace as it had been a while since I had been home. But I got bored being at home so I went to hella concerts seeing BLACKPINK, YOASOBI, and ODESZA (again). Once the quick month passed it was time to move to LA to begin graduate school. It was a familiar environment and it was extra familiar when I started working with my undergraduate PI for the real deal this time. This catches you up on the timeline but it truly was an amazing year around the world.
