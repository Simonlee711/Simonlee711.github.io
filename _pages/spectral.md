# Abstract 

  The Covid-19 pandemic has been a global issue for well over 2 years. However, recent reports suggests that it may be coming to an end with health officials claiming to treat it as a ``seasonal" endemic. Therefore to test the accuracy of these claims, our research runs time and spectral analysis on 8 countries Covid-19 time-series [data](https://github.com/datasets/covid-19/blob/main/data/time-series-19-covid-combined.csv). Our results reveal that the northern and southern hemisphere countries exhibit a series of outbreaks at the same time, strongly implying that there is no seasonal effect. In addition it also shows that outbreaks tend to occur bi-annually which also shows that it is very much still a pandemic. Therefore our data/analysis is potentially controversial as it disagrees with health officials and we strongly suggest it is premature to claim an end to this pandemic.
