## Version 1.0.5
**October 9, 2022**

On html there is no grammatical errors checker so I fixed a lot of the spelling and grammatical errors found on all the posts and the pages. Would be silly to present this website publicly without having proper syntax. Also updated website with new blog post about "Discipline".

## Version 1.0.4
**October 4, 2022**

I have been refining the website so much by correcting grammatical errors, and organizing the interface to be better. Therefore future HR managers or others who look through the website have a smoot experience on this website.

## Version 1.0.3
**September 14, 2022**

I know updates have been pretty frequent but that is due to my surplus of leisure time. In this update I add a website logo as well as a new blog post about the collatz conjecture. Promise the blog will slow down soon...

## Version 1.0.2
**Septmeber 13, 2022**

Updated some of my about page and added a new blog post. Since I have applied to internships already, I must make this website presentable.  

## Version 1.0.1
**Septmeber 12, 2022**

Alot of beta website errors like incorrect rendering of images, videos, and equations. Also updated the Where's my bread page with new game trailer as well as added paragraphs to the Physics engine as well as the AI design

## Version 1.0.0
**Sepetember 11, 2022**

The official launch of the website. Explore at your own free will.
