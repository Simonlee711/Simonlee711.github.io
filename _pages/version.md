## Version 1.0.4
**October 4, 2022**

I have been refining the website so much with correcting grammatical errors, allowing for users to visit everything. Whether thats future HR managers or others who look through the website.

## Version 1.0.3
**September 14, 2022**

I know updates have been pretty frequent but that is due to my surplus of leisure time. In this update I add a website logo as well as a new blog post about the collatz conjecture. Promise the blog will slow down soon...

## Version 1.0.2
**Septmeber 13, 2022**

Updated some of my about page and added a new blog post. Since I have applied to internships already, I must make this website presentable.  

## Version 1.0.1
**Septmeber 12, 2022**

Alot of beta website errors like incorrect rendering of images, videos, and equations. Also updated the Where's my bread page with new game trailer as well as added paragraphs to the Physics engine as well as the AI design

## Version 1.0.0
**Sepetember 11, 2022**

The official launch of the website. Explore at your own free will.
