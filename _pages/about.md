# Introduction
 
Hello. My name is Simon Austin Lee. I am currently a student at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne) in Switzerland. I am studying life sciences engineering and building my statistics and machine learning skills to strengthen my profile for a Ph.D. in computational biology/biomathematics research. My recent interests have been running machine learning algorithms to analyze healthcare and genetic data. The particular research focus I want to enter is precision medicine, where I hope to impact our understanding of diseases by leveraging healthcare information. My hope is to pursue a career in biomedical data science at the industry level in the near future. Therefore I am very open to any internships that currently offer practical experiences in the field.

# Past Education & Affiliations
 
### UCLA, Computational Medicine (Summer 2022)
 
In the summer of 2022, I worked as a computational and genomics analyst at UCLA within the computational medicine department under the Bruins in Genomics Summer Program. In this program, I worked with Dr. [Jeffrey Chaing](https://compmed.ucla.edu/member/chiang-phd) and Dr. Ákos Rudas to develop a deep learning pipeline that can predict future Arterial Blood Pressure. On top of working alongside these extraordinary scientists, I also got to meet a spectacular cohort of undergraduates across America who worked on other problems in computational biology. You can read more about the experience outside of work under my [Blog posts](https://simonlee711.github.io/blog/) tab. This experience was truly memorable, and I am grateful to have worked at a world-renowned university that runs cutting-edge research.

### UCSC Genomics Institute (2021-2022)
 
In Fall 2021, I entered [Dr. Vanessa Jonsson's](https://jonssonlab.com/) lab as an undergraduate researcher affiliated with the UCSC Genomics Institute. During my time in this institute, I collaborated with [Razvan Marinescu](http://www.mit.edu/~razvan/) (MIT Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence Laboratory) and [Vedu Mallela](https://people.csail.mit.edu/vmallela/) (Georgia Tech, School of Computing) on a single cell genomics problem. With a recent influx of biological data due to NGS & single-cell sequencing, we are trying to comprehend fundamental changes "cell-by-cell" rather than those at a population level. The hope in this field is that we can understand things like cancer, stem cells, aging, as well as the development of drug resistance to a much greater extent. Our objective was to map chromatin accessibility assays to gene expression profiles.
 
### Camp Kesem (2020-2022)

Camp Kesem is a college-run non-profit organization where college students volunteer their time year-round to fundraise and host a free summer camp for children whose parents are affected by cancer. While at this non-profit organization, I served as the treasurer of the UC Santa Cruz Chapter. As the treasurer, I got to use some of my mathematics to crunch some numbers and get hands-on experience working with financial data management through excel spreadsheets. More specifically, I managed chapter finances, filed company grants from local Santa Cruz non-profit businesses, and created budgets for all the expenses needed to host a summer camp. I enjoyed my time serving as a treasurer and counselor for this non-profit organization.

### UC Santa Cruz, Baskin School of Engineering (2019-2022)
 
In Spring 2022, I graduated with my Bachelor of Science in Applied Mathematics at UCSC's Jack Baskin School of Engineering with Summa Cum Laude honors. I initially entered as a pure mathematics major in the fall of 2019. However, I soon realized that logic and proofs were not the academic paths I wanted to pursue. Therefore in my second year at university, I took my first programming class and was forever changed. I ended up switching to the Applied mathematics department after the conclusion of my second year, where I focused primarily on computing and mathematical biology. Taking courses like numerical analysis, scientific computing, and data-driven modeling, I was inspired to use my quantitative background and work toward a new field at the graduate level.

# Goals
 
Some of my current goals are becoming more well-rounded and specialized in machine learning (supervised and unsupervised) and having the skills necessary to pursue data science oriented tasks. I also wanted to better understand the current biological research landscape by understanding the basics of life sciences. Therefore I have been taking various courses at EPFL that have helped me work toward this goal. Outside of my academic pursuits, I have been trying to read more and maintaining good fitness to live a healthier lifestyle.

# Outside Interests
 
Outside academics, I am widely interested in a few things. First and foremost is photography. I enjoy photography so much that I gave my hobby its tab [here](https://simonlee711.github.io/photos/). Photography has been my escape and a way to document my hectic young life. With everything going by so quickly, I forget every little thing that has happened. However, photography has been a way to capture the moment and gives me a chance to relive it again.
 
I have also been widely interested in traveling ever since moving to Europe. A lot of my freedom, I think, was deprived during COVID-19, like many people. Since then, I have only wanted to regain some of the years I lost in college ("the best time of our lives") by doing ambitious things (safely)! Since many neighboring big countries surround Switzerland, it has been accessible to travel. Also, Western Europe is central in reaching the USA, Africa, and Asia. I wish to travel to some of these areas when I have holiday breaks. Experiencing brand-new cultures has been widely rewarding because you are exposed to new ideas and experiences. Though California is pretty multicultural, nothing compares to the experiences spent inside another country. 

Lastly is just helping people. Throughout my whole life, helping people has been one of the most rewarding experiences that I have ever felt. It is something I value and has widely become why I wanted to pursue biomedical-type work. There was a time in my life when I was very ill with an autoimmune condition, and I spent a lot of my time being helped because there was not much I could do with my frail body. So life comes at you full circle. I plan to dedicate my time if time allows to hopefully go volunteer in Africa with a humanitarian group (UNICEF, etc.) during my breaks. This experience would probably allow me to travel! While also very much being able to help those who are in need.
