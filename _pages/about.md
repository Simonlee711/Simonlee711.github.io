# Introduction

Hello. My name is Simon Austin Lee. I am currently a first year graduate student at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne) in Switzerland. In graduate school I am currently pursuing a M.S. degree in Life Sciences Engineering with a specialization in Biological Data Science. My recent interests have been widely associated with running  machine learning algorithms on healthcare data. I wish to therefore pursue a career in biomedical data science at the industry level.

# Past Education & Affiliations

### UCLA, Computational Medicine

In the summer of 2022, I worked as a computational and genomics analyst at UCLA within the computational medicine department under the Bruins in Genomics Summer Program. In this program I worked alongside Dr. [Jeffrey Chaing](https://compmed.ucla.edu/member/chiang-phd) and Dr. Ákos Rudas on developing a deep learning pipeline that is able to predict Arterial Blood Pressure into the future. You can read more about the experience and the logistics under the [Projects tab](**fill here**) on this website. On top of working alongside these amazing scientists, I also got to meet a spectacular cohort of undergraduates all across America who worked on other problems in the field of computational biology. You can read more about the experience outside of work under my Blog posts tab. This experience was truly memorabale and I am grateful to have worked at such a world-renowned university which runs such cutting edge research. 

### UCSC Genomics Institute

In Fall 2021, I entered [Dr. Vanessa Jonsson's](https://jonssonlab.com/) lab as an undergraduate researcher and was therefore affiliated with the UCSC Genomics Institute. During my time in this institute I was collaborating with [Razvan Marinescu](http://www.mit.edu/~razvan/) (MIT Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence Laboratory) and [Vedu Mallela](https://people.csail.mit.edu/vmallela/) (Georgia Tech, School of Computing) on a single cell genomics problem. With a recent influx of biological data due to single-cell sequencing, we are able to comprehend key changes "cell-by-cell" rather than those at a population level. The hope in this field is that we can understand things like cancer, stem cells, aging, as well as the development of drug resistance to a much greater extent. You can read more about our research under the [Projects tab](**fill here**).

### UC Santa Cruz, Baskin School of Engineering

In Spring 2022, I graduated with my Bachelors in Science in Applied Mathematics at UCSC's Jack Baskin School of Engineering. I originally entered as a pure mathematics major in fall 2019 but soon realized that logic and proofs was not the academic path I wanted to pursue. Therefore in my second year at university, I took my first programming class and was forever changed. I ended up switching into the Applied mathematics department after the conclusion of my second year, where I focused primarily on computing and mathematical biology. Taking courses like numerical analysis, scientific computing, and data driven modeling, I was inspired to commit to a totally new field change at the graduate level. Thanks to the generalities of mathematics, I was able to pursue biological data science at the graduate level.

# Goals

Some of my recent goals consist on becoming specialized in deep learning, and have the skills necessary to pursue a field in data sciences. Over the summer I hope to return back to the USA to pursue an industrial internship in this field. Also after the completion of my masters degree, I likely will return to the San Francisco Bay area to pursue several dream companies to work at for a life time.
