# Welcome


Welcome to Simon Lee's Webpage! This webpage was intended to showcase some of my notable academic/professional projects, some pictures throughout the years, and to maintain a log of my monthly newsletters sent to individuals by request or by sign-up. Having encountered many people throughout my young life, I wanted to provide a medium for myself and others to stay in touch and follow my journey together. This year (2023), one of my New Year's Goals was to become a better writer, and I think there is no better way than to combine all these aspects into this webpage. Feel free to explore the webpage to learn more about me!


# Brief Introduction

{% include figure image_path="images/bs.jpg" alt="this is a placeholder image" caption="" %}

Hello, my name is Simon Lee, and I am currently a Data Scientist at Celsius Therapeutics in Cambridge, MA. I am also a soon-to-be Ph.D. student at the University of California, Los Angeles in the Department of Computational Medicine. I obtained a degree in Applied Mathematics where I had a high interest in computing, methods development, and machine learning applied to biology.


Like many people upon entering university, I had no idea what I wanted to do. However, I was always curious about many aspects of the world and I ultimately chose to study mathematics. In this study, I enjoyed the logical/abstract thinking as well as the broad applications it had on many social and physical sciences. This major very much suits my current personality where I was able to try many broad problems before ultimately converging on Mathematical Biology. My love for applied mathematics took a step further when I began learning about mathematical algorithms that made it possible to automate, first my Cryptography class, but also many other aspects of my life. Gaining these insights from pairing simple mathematics with programming truly opened up the doors to the scale and ambitions of problem-solving.


Throughout my academic career, I have had the opportunity to work with some amazing organizations and researchers both at the industry and academic levels. I have worked in the pharmaceutical/therapeutics field, single-cell genomics field, and the healthcare field just to name a few of my research endeavors. Some of my favorite notable projects were helping develop a model to continuously predict future blood pressure, as well as studying the periodicity of the COVID-19 Pandemic. Some of my current interests lie directly in the healthcare field pairing AI algorithms with Electronic Health Records to predict/study insights of a patient with its lucrative medical history.


Outside of Mathematics, I love to meet new people and explore the world. First and foremost, building relationships and friendships, no matter the duration is of utmost importance to me since I do not get here alone. I have had the incredible privilege to meet lovely people who have shaped my character/personality/skills and I am forever grateful to have had an amazing community throughout my whole life. I recently identified that surrounding myself with the right people is what truly makes me happy and I, therefore, love to continue to meet new people and share precious moments with them. Secondly, I love to travel the world. The world is our playground and I have had the privilege to visit/live in some fascinating countries like Morocco, Switzerland, Japan, and plenty more. As a young lad, there are so many things I want to experience and traveling has allowed me to diversify my culture/taste/experience. Last of all I want to and love to help others. For much of my life, I have had great physical/mental support and it is only right for me to pay it forward and do my part to bring light and happiness to the world.

And lastly some of my hobbies include spending time with friends, game development, basketball & working out, and photography.
