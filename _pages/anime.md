# Introducing the concept

Artificial Intellegence has widely slipped under the cracks of how appparent it is within our daily lives. One of the most fascinating applications of AI has been within the realm of recommendation systems.

In a nutshell, a recommender system is a tool that suggests you the next content given what you have already seen and liked. Companies like Youtube, Netflix and Amazon have long used recommender systems to suggest you the next video or song to suggest products that you may be widely interested in purchasing. These systems have been very advanced for many years and by no means are we going to top them. However we wanted to try an approach using Natural language processing to showcase similarities between shows and recommend them mathematically using a cosine similarity function.

This page and code tutorial showcases our entire pipeline from data processing all the way down to the algorithms and models and it actually works quite incredibly well.
