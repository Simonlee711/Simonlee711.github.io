```Projects```

</br>

In this tab you will see some of the personal and academic projects I have done over the years. This is my projects portfolio containing a wide array of different projects. Within each project you will get an in-depth description as well as any source code/papers/posters that go along with each associated project. On top of if there were any group collaborations, I will provide their contact information within each subpage. Feel free to roam around and if there are any questions regarding the projects, feel free to contact me at ```simonlee711@gmail.com``` or ```simon.lee@epfl.ch. </br></br>
