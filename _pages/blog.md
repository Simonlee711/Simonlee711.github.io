# Description

Below you can find my blog posts in reverse sequential order by date. You can also find indiviudal blog posts at my home page. I started a blog because writing has been another hobby that has given me joy. There is a beauty in conveying messages through writing, and I think its a dying skill nowadays. I've been often told that my writing can sometimes be all over the place, so this is also a way to improve my writing. Therefore the goal is to convey topics I find interesting every week and explain my enthusiasm to a general audience. There may be more technical posts sometimes but my goal is to do my best to explain things better and simpler for anyone to understand. This will be an ongoing project where I will cover a variety of topics: Europe, Math/Sciences, Miscallaneous. I will attempt to write 1 to 2 posts a week based on time. I hope you enjoy!

## Terrance Tao
#### October 30, 2022


This week the audience is lucky to get two blog posts in one weekend. Today's second half of the dual blog post is about a famous mathematician, Terrance Tao. I have heard of him since my time as an undergraduate student. However, I just found out the extent of his brilliance recently. For those who do not know, he is considered the "Mozarts of Mathematics" because math flows through him. However, recently you may have seen him in online ads for his latest masterclass, where he teaches problem-solving. Today I wanted to discuss his brief biography and what lessons I have taken from his incredible life.

### Biography

Terrance Tao is an Australian-American Mathematician and is regarded as the most brilliant mathematician alive. He currently works at the University of California, Los Angeles. He has been working there since he was TWENTY years old. However, like every professor, he went through the same process to get to his point of success. At age 5, he was academically ahead by a landslide which allowed him to skip many grades. This advancement he felt allowed him to comprehend and use differential Calculus by age 7. During his High school years, which lasted a little longer than usual, he was concurrently enrolled at Flinders University in Adelaide, where Garth Gaudry taught him. At this age he began competing in Mathematics Olympiads and became the youngest gold medal winner at 13 years old. We can already see that from a young age, he had a brilliant mind, but the next seven years were filled with even more incredible feats. At 14, he began full-time university at Flinders University. He was awarded a B.Sc. with Honors in December 1991, completing his undergraduate degree at just 16. He later completed a master's degree at the same Flinders University within a year and began a Ph.D. at Princeton the following year. For the next three years, he was advised by Elias Stein. He went on to complete his Ph.D., being awarded for his thesis on "Three regularity results in harmonic analysis." 

After schooling, he entered his professorship at UCLA at TWENTY (still crazy). Four years later, he was promoted to a full-time professor and has been a leading contributor in many aspects of mathematics. He is truly a man of incredible intelligence. He has been rewarded with the Fields Medal, the highest award you can get as a mathematician. His contributions to the field are something else. He once wrote 54 QUALITY publications in a year, whereas an ordinary professor would be lucky enough to release 1 or 2. I therefore wanted to share an excerpt of some of the contributions he made to the field:

*"First, it describes his work with Ben Green on the distribution of prime numbers. They proved the remarkable result that the primes contain arithmetic progressions of any length. To dismiss this fantastic achievement in a single sentence seems silly, but there is much more to say. An area to which Tao has made many contributions is the Kakeya problem. This problem, originally posed in 2 dimensions, asked for the minimum area of a shape in which one can rotate a needle through 180°. The answer is surprising; you can make the area less than any chosen number. Tao has worked on the nn-dimensional Kakeya problem, where the minimum volume can be as small as one chooses. However, the fractal dimension of the shape is unknown. This problem sounds rather specialized, but on the contrary, there are surprising connections to Fourier analysis and nonlinear waves. Another area in which Tao has worked in solving special cases of the equations of general relativity describing gravity. Imposing cylindrical symmetry on the equations leads to the "wave maps" problem where, although it has yet to be solved, Tao's contributions have led to a great resurgence of interest since his ideas seem to have made a solution possible. Another area where Tao has introduced novel ideas, giving the subject a whole new look, is the theory of the nonlinear Schrödinger equations. These equations have considerable practical applications, and again Tao's insights have shed considerable light on the behavior of a particular Schrödinger equation."*

Though this biography has been relatively concise and could be shared in much greater detail, I am still determining to what extent people find his fascination, so I will keep it short for the case of my general audience. 

# What this means for me

As far as I can remember, one of my dreams was to be perceived as a creatively intelligent thinker. Becoming a specialist or a master of a field always had a nice twist, and it's still a goal I have been chasing. Though it's a rather strange goal, I have been inspired by people like John Nash and Alan Turing. Dr. Nash is another famous mathematician known for his Nash Equilibrium and contributions to Game theory. For those unaware of John Nash's story, he was a brilliant mathematician who dealt with Schizophrenia from his early adulthood. Though he faced mental hardships, everyone describes him as having a "beautiful mind" and seeing the world differently than an average person would. Another big inspiration was mathematician/computer scientist Alan Turing, who helped the British government pioneer the technology to decrypt Nazi Germany's secret communications during World War II. Though his life ended tragically, he was still a big source of inspiration to me. He was regarded as the father of cryptography and computing. Some of his work lives on in the field of artificial intelligence, known as the Turing test, to see if a computer can independently exhibit intelligent behavior like a human being. To this day, no computer has beaten the Turing test, and it has been a good indication that artificial intelligence is not as far as we think it is.

These two mathematicians have been academic inspirations in my life, and it is safe to say that Terrence Tao deserves a seat at this small round table. As I continue to chase my goal of becoing a creatively intelligent thinker, I also wanted to share some of Terrance's words which I found valuable in a recent interview he did on Youtube. He explains that doing something you love is super important when you pursue an advanced education. While this seems straightforward to some, this is not the case for many. After all, I am still determining if the college system has an inherent big issue. For example, I have met plenty of people who do not enjoy what they study. This typically results in doing a job that they do not love. But Terry credits his success on simply loving what he does, which has often resulted in solving many problems that mathematicians have been stuck on for years. Moving forward, this is an essential lesson because loving what you do may be the only thing you need to sustain happiness for the next \\ (X\\) amount of years. So I plan to take his advice in preparation for what I plan to do next after schooling.

On top of his words, I also realized through him that you are as far as you will take yourself. Many of us dream significantly about being wealthy or attaining specific achievable goals. However not everyone reaches these goals ever and it is really determined with how much time you put into is what you will get out of it. Though Terrance Tao is an extreme outlier compared to our population, there is no reason why I can't be like him. Although I don't know his explicit goals, just being passionate and working hard at somthing you love is something I want to take with me moving forward. And while there are more distractions nowadays, reading his biography has added a source of inspiration for me to chase greatness. I am lucky enough to be in a current field where it is relatively new, so I hope that I can be a significant reason in some minor specialization as to why its important and impactful. This transfer of knowledge and inspiration from people to people is so valuable because you never know whom it will immensely affect. Therefore from today and moving on, I will be more intently with myself and what I can do to make my imprint in today's world. This blog is a way to share my thoughts and expressions but I really want to work on showing results instead of strictly talking about them. This is another goal added to my plate and I look forward to continue to excel. Thanks for reading and I will catch you again next week.

## Attitude
#### October 29, 2022

It is safe to say that life has not been easy. However, this may be the case for many people around the world. For this reason, I wanted to provide an update and explain why a change in attitude is all you need to turn your life around. My most significant barrier when struggling is oftentimes myself. After all, there is no pressure unless you inflict it upon yourself. I am not a life coach so please do take my words with a grain of salt. But, there is value in sharing perspectives from different points of view, which has been one of my most proud attributes about growing myself.

## The Importance of Attitude

Since arriving in Europe, I have been bombarded with schoolwork and remain in a relatively challenging housing environment (I have to commute to school from a different country!). This early amount of "stress" if you will has resulted in simply not having enough time to execute everything to perfection. My two most considerable sacrifices since moving here have been a poor diet and a lack of sleep. However, these two things are relatively normal, considering what most university students go through. This ties back to a previous blog post about discipline but the looming question I think about is whether my lifestyle is maintainable? 

My academic success has come from approaching school as a scheduling problem. Throughout the quarter/semester, my goal in the early weeks are to catch what "patterns" work throughout the week. I check for classes that might grade particularly hard or require my attendance to succeed in a course. Once I am able to identify these things I can apply a significance level or "weights" to a specific class and almost construct a new schedule. I am operating like a machine learning algorithm if you will. So to catch you up in the timeline, I have just completed week 6/14 and have officially made it almost halfway through the semester. I have fine-tuned my schedule quite a bit. I still attend all lectures. However, I only go to exercise sections that I know will be worth my time. Dropping these 2-hour exercise sections has freed up a lot of my time to have some "additional time" throughout the week, and I think I have found a schedule that works for me. So in this sense I think my life has "chilled out" a bit.

But today's big topic I wanted to discuss was attitude. As alluded to in the introduction, the most significant barrier we face is oftentimes ourselves. I have been a prisoner to this thought, where I often inflict pressure on myself. In most cases this behavior is justified considering that we have deadlines to meet and things we have to get done but I am also a firm believer that this is only the case in some situations. 

Since coming here it is safe to say that I have been slightly socially deprived. It is impossible to go out with anyone since the ferry does not run that late. Therefore while it has been a personal struggle, I have now twisted this thought into asking, "Is my social activity expectations too high?" This is a person-dependent question, and some recency bias has convoluted my expectation. During the summer in Los Angeles, I worked hard and played hard. It was a formula that worked for me throughout college and was taken to another extent during the summer. From 9-5, I worked, and from 5 onward, I was usually up to something during my time in Los Angeles. Therefore coming from this environment into a totally new one has resulted in me returning to reality. So while my social activity is spread out thin, this is a more normal expectation than I was previously used to. Just changing my perspective on little things has resulted in finding peace with myself and being okay with not doing a lot of social activities. 

Another change in perspective has been my daily interactions with my fellow classmates. My slight pet peeve about this school has been some students' big egos and pretentiousness. When speaking or working with these students, there has been a small annoyance. But this week I once again took a step back. In order to succeed, I have dropped my perceptions and have tried to piece everyone's strengths to the betterment of the group. For example, if someone confidently understands signals processing, and I understand the mathematical theory behind the concept, we can combine our knowledge to succeed as a group. While this process has taken more time to get used to, I think my annoyance with these people reflects a small sample size of the actual people that attend this school. I have made a nice group of friends that I don't feel this sentiment towards, and I have started to look forward to these interactions more throughout the week. Also, I have been exposed to several new cultural norms and traditions by simply being here. Many students come from all over the world, so it has been valuable to hear stories about their respective homes. I hope to therefore retain these relationships in order to keep in touch with friends was all over the world!

The last transformation I have applied within my daily routine is how I perceive the daily commutes. The daily commutes are painful to some extent because I have to wake up way earlier than I want to, not to mention that it takes roughly 3 hours of my day as well. However, the ferry rides have been relaxing to cruise across the fresh waters of Lac Leman. Often on my way back "home," I sit outside to watch the sunset and catch the fresh air. This routine refreshes my mind for about 35 minutes and allows me to detox and prepare me to work afterwards. 

All these small changes I have applied have resulted in a massive transformation in my life. Not having daily or even weekly expectations has been a way to comfort my mind. While this may be questionable to some extent, I will assure you that I still have expectations, but they aren't as critical. And one of the important lessons I can take away from this realization is that this can be applied to any situation. A change of perspective and attitude can totally change how you perceive the world around you. And another short reminder is that there are many people who are struggling as well. At times I have felt that a superstitious figure has been lashing out at me by presenting hardships and barriers, but this is a more general case to the many people fighting their own battles. Taking a step back to reflect and apply small changes can therefore change your life. After all I have been extremely blessed to experience so many new things all the time. When I tell myself I have moved to another country, it is often surreal that I have taken this for granted. Switzerland has been nothing short of amazing and I have even planned a visit to Prague, Czech Republic in the coming weeks. I've also already had the chance to visit Brussels, Belgium, and Paris, France. So really in the grand scheme of things, I feel lucky to be in the position I am in despite some minor obstacles. I am doing well and have been doing especially well thanks to this change in attitude. I hope you can take something from my blog post, and thanks again for reading!

## Infinity
#### October 16, 2022


## Disclaimer
 
This is a challenging read because it is technical, but I tried to explain it as simply as possible. I also think this is one of the most exciting blog posts, so even if it's hard and long, I recommend you read through the whole thing.
 

 
## Introduction
 
<image src="/images/space.gif" alt="Spinners" width="650" caption="Infinitely moving in one direction" />
 
I just finished watching an incredible documentary about infinity. However, it first leads to the question: what is infinity? A number, a concept, a spatial or temporal domain? I guess the answer depends on whom we are talking to. So the next question that comes to mind is can we visualize infinity? I will provide a mathematical example.
 
\\[ \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{16} ... + \frac{1}{2^{n}} = 1\\]
 
If you add an infinite sequence of this given equation, you will always end up at one. If you have ever taken Calculus, you should be able to detect that this is a convergent series, which means that adding an infinite amount of numbers will sum to a finite number. However, let's look at its counterpart: divergent series. If we add the following, we should get infinity:
 
\\[ 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 ... + n = \infty \\]
 
Let's take it a step further by bringing our sum and adding 1. We should get some sequence like this
 
\\[ \infty + 1 = \infty \\]
 
However, this is a paradox. Let me demonstrate why. If we were to subtract infinity from both sides now, we would get a famous mathematical expression:
 
\\[ 1 = 0 \\]
 
This makes no sense. Many things do not make any feasible sense in the concept of infinity, and it can often lead to existential spirals of thoughts. Therefore, I thought it would be interesting to present some of the things I learned from this documentary that hurt your head! So get ready to dive into some physics, permutations, and existential life as we know it.
 

 
## The ∞ Hotel Paradox
 
Suppose we have a hotel that can fit an infinite amount of people. But first, this special hotel has some rules you should know before you proceed. The hotel is always full. However, there is also always space for new customers... So if a new customer wanted to stay the night at the hotel, everyone would move to room number \\( n+1 \\), where n is their current hotel number. Sounds easy enough, right? The next evening, an infinite number of people want an infinite number of rooms to stay in since the hotel always has free space. However the customers will not move \\( n+ \infty \\) rooms. Instead there is a even more clever solution: \\( n * 2 \\). So if you were in room 1, you would move to room 2, 2->4, 3->6, 4->8, and it goes on and on and on. What did you do? You freed up every odd hotel room, and now there are an infinite number of rooms for an infinite number of customers. Well done.

Some people have proposed that perhaps appending the new customers to \\( \infty \\) seems easier and must be more straightforward. However, the issue with this approach is that no one knows where the end of the hotel, aka room infinity, is. Therefore since it is not a finite quantity, this approach will never work. This leads us to the idea that not all infinities are the same, which we also learned in calculus. This idea of infinity is starting to become scary, and it's only about to worsen.
 

 
## ∞ is small
 
Typically we think that infinity is a large quantity. However, let me demonstrate that infinity can also be a small quantity. How many numbers lie between 100 and 101? That's right; it's infinite. Suppose we visualize numbers like the data structure, stack. In that case, if we keep pushing on 0 to the top of our stack, there is an endless amount of quantities that lie between these numbers (i.e., 0.00001, 0.0000000000001,...). So how do we control infinity if it is both enormous and small?
 

 
## Calculus
 
Calculus is complex and confusing, and it was not one of my favorite subjects in high school. However, maturing is knowing that everything that changes is modeled through calculus. Whether it's movement, a complex system, or even how pandemics work, we need calculus to make sense of it. So based on our definition, we can use infinity to explain the world around us. After all, as a mathematician, we know that something exists if you can observe it and constrain it using a set of tools. Calculus is that tool. So let's say we have a curve that models the position of the Earth around the sun. We can model the orbit or the curve as an infinitely discretized set of lines that give us an "orbital feature ."If we constrained our elliptic behavior to be  \\( n = 5 \\) lines, we would have a very bumpy pentagon-like orbit around the sun. But with this infinite discretization, we can model any rotation and even curve, all revolving around our time constant. And what makes this infinite discretization awesome is that we can simplify complex systems. Take, for example, a Fourier series [1]. In simple terms, a Fourier series is an infinite number of sines and cosines summed together to form any possible waveform. Using the power of the Fourier series and the number of times it takes to get through one cycle, mathematicians have concatenated a whole bunch of different series to draw pictures using these Fourier series... simply INCREDIBLE.
 
<image src="/images/bird.gif" alt="Spinners" width="650"  caption="Fourier Series Drawings" />
 
What I am trying to get at is that this "bird artist" is a complex set of mathematical series, all added on top of one another. But by breaking each series into individual parts, mathematicians could figure out how to draw birds from freaking vectors! This idea of studying simple systems to explain bigger ones is a massive application in systems biology, electrical engineering, etc. Our brain is only a finite amount of space, so we need to find ways to understand large systems in more accessible terms. This simple to complex mindset has led to many significant discoveries. One is electricity which has revolutionized our world.
 

 
## Where to find ∞
 
I've tried to help you visualize infinity. However, now these concepts lead to a bigger question: Does infinity exist in our physical realm? And to that, we say yes and no.
 
Due to its properties, physicists will often refer to black holes as a physical form of infinity. So what exactly is a black hole? In simple terms, it's a massive hole that packs matter so tightly that nothing gets out of this condensed space. This is why we virtually know nothing about it. A visualization of these systems was best seen in the movie "Interstellar," where physicists say its visualization is pretty accurate to the one they imagine. It has a beautiful event horizon, as seen in the gif below.
 
<image src="/images/hole.gif" alt="Spinners" width="650" caption="Black hole visualized" />
 
So how exactly do black holes resemble infinity? We will use Einstein's theory of relativity to theoretically explain how these compare and what occurs inside a black hole. According to Einstein, entering a black hole will feel like you're falling infinitely; however, this falling stage is finite. Einstein believes that at some point, you will hit the "floor" of the black hole, called the singularity: an infinite curvature in space-time where all the mass of the black hole is concentrated. The environment has infinite density, and it is catastrophic. It is so catastrophic that being here will break physics and you will become unobservable. You literally cease to exist anymore. I do not want to go beyond this explanation because the world as we know it is broken when you are in a black hole. Therefore no more questions were asked, according to Einstein.
 
However, a group of physicists refuses to accept Einstein's theory and believes a Black hole is a wormhole. A wormhole is simply two distant points in time connected with a funnel shape. Therefore you can get from point to point almost instantaneously. I say almost instantaneously because there also exist things in our world that are not infinite. One of them is speed. Speed has a max value of 299 792 458 meters/sec, aka the speed of light, meaning no "thing" can move faster than this speed. So if two points were billions of light years away, they would still be constrained by the speed of light.
 
|![image-center](/images/worm.jpg){: .align-center style="width: 100%;"}|
|:--:| 
| *Visual of the wormhole: distant spatial points connected by a funnel* |

This leads us to an exciting topic about infinite time. Is time infinite? What would happen to an object in infinite time? This is where a science experiment was proposed about an object in a box. Let's say an orange was placed in a box. Over ten days, it would begin to rot; over 100 years, it may be disintegrated into dust by the bacteria. However, based on the law of thermodynamics, the energy and the atoms within this object would freely move across the box and take different forms. For an orange of a given fixed size, it may have \\( 10^{10^{24}} \\) various permutations the atoms can take form as. While this is a vast number, at some point, the orange will run out of conditions it can take shape. So after an infinite amount of time, if we opened up the box, scientists believe we will have our orange, ideally in a healthy form on its own lying there.
 
This idea of having finite solutions within an observable space leads us to our universe.
 

 
## Parallel Universes
 
Space is believed to be infinite. However, observable space, or a couple of galaxies that we know exist, is a finite-dimensional space. And suppose we were to view this finite-dimensional space as a composition of tiny cubic voxels. In that case, a finite amount of voxels compose our "universe ."Let's say there were particular states or orientations our universe could be in. This idea puts a limited constraint on the number of permutation designs our universe can take form as. Therefore within the finite dimensions we know (observable space), there is a limitation of what our universe can look like. So what could make space infinite?
 
This is where sh*it starts to get crazy. What if there were copies of our orientation of the universe at an unreachable distance away? It is only inaccessible to us because we mentioned earlier that speed has a maximum of 299 792 458 meters/sec. It may simply just be a couple of too many billion years away. However, what if in this infinity resulted into the idea of a parallel universe, where there are infinite different decisions we could make going on simultaneouly in infinite time? Imagine our lives modeled as decision trees where we might have wanted to ask our crush how that decision can widely impact the subsequent sequences.
 
|![image-center](/images/tree.jpg){: .align-center style="width: 100%;"}|
|:--:| 
| *Video Game Decision Trees that can resemble decision trees in our own lives* |
 
It is like the time stone and what they used in "Avengers Infinity wars." So we can see that infinite permutations can occur within our own lives. The crazy thought is that those infinite decision paths are being executed, most likely in parallel at some distant spatial point... Crazy. And we can not see ourselves in a parallel universe as a millionaire or being reincarnated as a sheep because we are not in the proximity of our parallel universes where we infinitely exist in infinitely other spatial points. Bummer.
 
Now to those who do not believe me about the maximum value at which a thing can travel, I will present another example of the speed of light in action. The stars we see at night are minuscule because they are billions of light years away from the Earth. And so, every night we see the stars, these are image projections of where the planet was in the past. Because that star's light traveled a billion light years in distance, by the time it reaches you, that star is definitely in a much farther position in space. Isn't that a crazy thought in itself? If far enough, everything we see in the night sky is a past projection of where that star, comet, or planet was light years before. It is because light travels at a constant 299 792 458 meters/sec that it took us so long for us to able to perceive it.
 
|![image-center](/images/light.jpeg){: .align-center style="width: 100%;"}|
|:--:| 
| *A hand-drawn drawing of what our eyes perceive when we see planet X, in this case,* |
 

 
## Just a Spec in the Universe
 
Now that we know that light is the fastest thing in our universe, and even that is too slow, what does that make of us? If the universe is infinite, why even bother exploring other possible exo-planets that humans can inhabit? As someone who was a big supporter of space exploration as a kid, it also makes me wonder that this may be one of the most useless uses of our funds if they are not within a reachable point (i.e., our solar system). Even then, to get to Mars, or Jupiter's moon, Europa, it would still take an incredible amount of time that is not worth it in the end.
 
This loss of hope in space exploration and trying to expand human beings to be multi-terrestrial raises the question: *Does anything matter?* All the damage humans have caused on Earth is pretty irreversible, and what has been done to preserve mother Earth? On the contrary, we are also just specks in this infinite universe living in an extremely short finite time interval. *So, what are we trying to accomplish in our lives while we are here?* This is where thinking too hard can lead to a downward spiral. If you think logically, there truly is no purpose to our lives, but I believe humans have been able to add meaning to this meaningless world.
 
As complex as the world is, humans are just as complex, and emotions are what personally sway me. Perhaps I can feel sentiment, anger, or happiness towards something, which makes life the way it is. We can go down all these loopholes about whether death is infinite or God is the concept of infinity, but we will save those for another time. However, I briefly wanted to discuss whether love is boundless (infinite). This may be a physical thing in our world that is an observable infinity. I want to believe it is but is it possible to love someone for the whole duration of your life? Throughout my short life, I have held onto a few friends for extended periods. I have met people that I want to love forever, but I guess this idea of whether love is infinite is subjective from person to person. So to answer it from my perspective, only time will tell.
 
So let's go back to the theoretical side and ask, what if we went in one direction infinitely forever? Truth is just like the Earth; physicists believe the universe is some spherical shape. Therefore if we went in one order for an infinite amount of time, we would end up at the same place we started. However, physicists also believe that the universe's shape is expanding at an accelerating rate which means that our galaxies are repulsing against one another. What this means for us is absolutely nothing. However, in the grand scheme of the feasible spacial domain, this may mean the timeline of life in the universe is finite. A universe will always exist, but life as we know it may cease to exist (predicted in 100 billion years). So life is just like us and living in a short time interval that won't last forever. This makes life's history short and infinity that much larger.
 

 
## So what
 
The truth is that no one should care. A lot of theoretical physics and mathematics is being done purely to understand the universe we live in. I will conclude with one last thought. Are humans infinite? Will there be an infinite variety of human beings for the next 100 billion years? The answer is probably not, but there is no way to compare human beings due to their short life spans. However, I have reached this argument because, like the observable universe, our brains can only hold so many neurons. And these neurons can be intertwined in an exponential amount of ways, but this number is likely to be still finite. So based on everything that was discussed in this blog post, I believe that due to the limited amount of permutations of our brains, humans themselves also cannot be infinite.
 
So this leads me back to one last question: What is infinity?

## Discipline
#### October 8, 2022

Europe has been full of experiences where I feel like I have had to grow up by 10+ years. However, what's crazy is that I have only been here for two months. To be brutally honest, moving to this new country has not been the smoothest transition. But I believe that is just one of the things you risk when you are ambitious. I did not plan a lot during the summer since I was not physically in the country. However, a lack of preparedness raised the discomfort bar tenfold. Therefore, today I wanted to talk about discipline and what it has meant and been for me since I arrived in Europe.
 
I define discipline as having a sense of self-control and holding yourself accountable. I must be very disciplined and sharp nearly every day to live the life I thought of upon my arrival to Switzerland. For those who are not aware, I have been living in Evian-les-bains, France, a whole different country from where I attend school. I commute by ferry AND metro every day, and discipline starts every morning at around 5:50 am when I have to wake up for my commute to school. Every morning I wake up at 5:50 am so I can shower, prepare a full day of food, and pack all my belongings I will need for my classes throughout the day. Also, note that my first class does not begin until 8:00 am or 9:00 am every morning. After doing my morning preparation, I walk to the dock where I board the ferry. Typically, it is pitch black, with the sun not rising for another 30 minutes or so. I purposefully get to the dock early because I can board the ferry sooner. Once the ferry leaves the port at 7:00 am, I usually read a textbook or book for the 35-minute journey. Every morning starts like this, and since I consider myself punctual as well, the actual marathon begins after leaving the ferry.
 
To help picture the scene, it is around 7:35 am, and I am preparing to take the metro directly to EPFL. However, the commute to EPFL varies on average of about 21 minutes with a standard deviation of +/- 4 [17min, 25min]. This is due to no space on the metro, catching consecutive lines, and other super variable factors. However, since I have class at 8:00 am, I always want to be on the earlier side so I can arrive without being late for class. So as soon as I get off the ferry, I power walk to the metro station, which takes roughly 4 minutes to catch the literal next possible metro. After around five stations from Ouchy to Lausanne Flon, I have to switch metro lines to catch another metro that leads me directly to the school. A part of me always wants to wait for when there is space, but I am not built like that. After getting to EPFL, I have around 3-5 minutes to walk to my classrooms.
 
Once I arrive at school, I prepare to spend a whole day there. Because my commute back home takes around 3 hours there and back, it does not make sense for me to go home every time I have breaks. However, this is not usually an issue because I have around 8 hours of lectures and sections per day. Therefore this only explains part of the discipline I have to hold myself to every day.
 
I slightly alluded to having to pack food for a whole day. Though it seems relatively unimportant, it is an essential part of my life as a student. Because I start my days at 5:50 am and do not get home until around 7-8:00 pm, I have to pack my food. Though there are many campus restaurants and grocery stores nearby, I must note that I am financially supporting myself. As someone who has worked during my time as an undergraduate student, you can probably infer that I do not have much savings overall. Therefore, from a financial point of view, I am physically unable to sustain eating out while paying for all the other essentials in my life (rent, groceries, commute passes, etc.). So while all my friends and classmates can eat out daily, I usually bring lunch from home. Nutritiously, my lunch is not great (usually the same sandwich and chips daily), but it is enough to keep me through the day. I sometimes think I can buy food, which is equivalent to accepting defeat. Therefore, I tell myself I must remain disciplined throughout the day and, most likely, throughout the year.
 
After my evening classes conclude around 6:00 pm, the ferry schedule is not great, with ferries coming every 1hr 20min +/- 15 min. I must leave school immediately to catch the next ferry at 6:40 pm. Usually, boat boarding begins at 6:25 pm, so the earlier, the better. Once I get off the boat at around 7:15 pm, I walk back and arrive at my Airbnb at around 7:30 pm. Once I get home, I shower and then prepare myself dinner. Dinner usually entails pasta, noodles, and rice, and there has not been much diversity in foods besides that. I quickly eat so I can begin homework and read the material we covered in class that day. I usually cut myself off at 11 pm to get roughly six and a half hours of sleep. I set this limit because I used to stay up much later but would be super drowsy at school.
 
This cycle repeats nearly daily and has been a relatively rough schedule. However, thanks to my discipline, I can repeat these sequences of events every day. I always considered myself hardworking and disciplined, but moving here has shown me a new level to this feat--I am doing well, in any case. I am learning a lot which is great, and I have come to enjoy my daily treks across the 35-minute Lac Leman ferry ride. I guess I knew things would not be easy, but hey, as long as I stay disciplined, which I know I can be, I can make this life work. So thanks for reading!

## EPFL Business Culture & Education System
#### October 1, 2022

### Business Approach to School
 
As some may know, I have recently begun school at EPFL in Lausanne, Switzerland. EPFL is a world-renowned engineering university, and interestingly enough, they also have a passion for business. Upon my arrival into this new education system, they have made intellectual property and riding through with your ideas a high priority. At least when I was an undergraduate student at UC Santa Cruz, I was not exposed to this entrepreneurship mindset. Few people were beginning start-ups, and I think the innovation side of things was never really integrated into my college education. With that said, coming to EPFL has been mind-opening. They are passionate about their students and alums to be the world's next big business.
 
Before school even started, we had a welcome day. On this welcome day, the president of EPFL spoke to us at their massive Swiss Tech Convention Center, where they talked about a variety of events that they hold to get into business. These events included company recruitments, entrepreneurial contests, and TED talks. However, from day 0, the president set the bar high for anyone that stepped foot on our campus by bringing in one of his most famous alums, Daniel Borel, the founder of *Logitech*. Mr. Borel talked about his experiences at this school and how practical his time here was for the success of his now-massive company. One of the most exciting aspects of his speech was how the school itself empowered him to take that initial risk. Therefore this multimillionaire co-founder delivered a similar message in which he told us to take risks and build on innovative ideas. He said that if you believed in your product, you could tell others to do the same. Though I never intended to be a company's CEO due to my lack of business knowledge, I took his advice. I will explore it during my time here. So while I never intended to learn business, entrepreneurship, or what it takes to begin a start-up, I am lucky that just being present here will teach me a thing or two about this significant subject.
 
This theme, believe it or not, also stems in the classrooms. Since I am a student in the school of life sciences, this has been especially apparent. Biotech and pharma have become extremely massive industries, and it is only projected to get larger with the recent influx of biological data. Therefore cutting-edge technologies like CRISPR, NGS, etc., have opened doors to explore some of the world's most ambitious problems in drug discovery, biomedical sciences, and genetics. So even in my biology courses, this business mindset has been apparent, and it is not far off until I start a company.... just kidding....

 
### Education system
 
In addition to the business aspect, experiencing a brand-new education system has also been eye-opening. Switzerland has a shocking 51% passing rate amongst 1st-year bachelor's students due to their education system. I want to therefore explain their system and why nearly half of the school never obtain a bachelor's degree:
 
Unlike in the US, you can go to any university if you have a high school diploma. However, to regulate the university's population density, they need an efficient form of filtering out students. The top two famous Swiss universities, EPFL and ETH, have the highest fail rate amongst their students, thanks to their filtering system. Because both these schools are strictly engineering, all 1st-year bachelor students typically take the same courses in mathematics and physics that they will need in their engineering disciplines. Whether you are a computer scientist, electrical/mechanical/bio/civil engineer, or an architect, you will need some foundational knowledge of mathematics and physics. Therefore they teach you everything from Calculus to Fourier transforms, all within a year. To contrast this to my education, I was never introduced to the Fourier series/changes until my final year at university. For this reason, it is safe to say that this education system is brutal for the new 18-year-olds that enter EPFL/ETH.
 
Unsurprisingly, many students fail because the workload is far more than a full-time job in the USA. The unit (ECT) system here is borderline insanity for any student attending this school. The scale is typically for every ECT you take, you are required to do double the amount of hours. They also advise students to take roughly 30 ECTs a semester to stay on track to graduate on time. To contextualize this educational insanity, I am currently taking 32 ECTs. The expectation is that I will work double the amount of ECTs in hours per week. This means I have to work around 64 hours weekly to keep up with the curriculum. So all students who attend school at EPFL or ETH have to go through many years of an intense workload. To put my thoughts on this education system, I am unsure if it is healthy. Speaking with the Swiss locals, they say there is no time to do other activities and that they need to mentally prepare themselves to receive a bachelor's degree. On top of that, a bachelor is deemed worthless in the European workforce. Most careers require a minimum of a master's degree for any work. Students at EPFL/ETH therefore typically take these massive schedules for five years...
 
This education system is far more intense than the one I just came from in the USA. There also appears to be this propaganda in Europe that America is superior and ahead by many years. Swiss locals have expressed how their professors have been telling them for years that without this lifestyle, they would not survive in America. They are always shocked to hear when I tell them this is not true at all. During my undergraduate degree, I took four classes on average and could do other extracurriculars during this time. Therefore talking to these people has been interesting. Since I am just starting school, I have not felt this pressure yet, but I am preparing myself for the worst throughout the semester. I have school for 14 straight weeks and do not get a single holiday break until we get off of school on Christmas Eve! So while it's been a unique experience, I am trying to mentally prepare myself for this intensive workload that is to come. Wish me the best...
 
Thanks for reading!

## BIG Summer 2022
#### September 29, 2022

I was fortunate to spend this summer at UCLA as part of the Bruins in Genomics summer program. Suppose you are more interested in the research side of things. In that case, I highly recommend you check that out under the projects tab, where I wrote about my summer research. This post is more about life at UCLA and all the great people I could meet.
 
I first heard about this program from Professor Vanessa Jonsson, my research advisor at UCSC. She told me it would be an excellent opportunity to get in the door if I wanted to enter biomathematics. At the time, I was unsure what exactly I wanted to do. However, there was some interest after working on research with Professor Jonsson. I also knew it would be my first summer after college. I gave this opportunity a chance anyway because I needed practical experience for any job. I applied, and a few weeks later, I got in! I was thrilled since I wanted to do my undergraduate degree at UCLA but was never ready when I had completed high school. So roughly in March, when I was accepted, I knew I would spend my summer in Lala Los Angeles.
 
Los Angeles was exciting for a few reasons. First, the city is iconic and pictured in the movies as this super sunny, lovely beachy city that produces the best movie stars. My favorite movie is La La Land, and that movie's plot and presentation had me excited to spend my summer there. Additionally, as a sports fan, I was a huge Los Angeles Lakers fan, so that was another reason to look forward to the opportunity. Though they weren't in season in the summer, just being in the city with the world's biggest stars excited me.
 
Fast forward to June; truth be told, I was a little sad at the time. I had just graduated college, which is supposed to be the happiest years of my life, and it was very unclear where or when I would see some of the people I met at UCSC for the next time. Closing a chapter of your life is never easy because of all the precious times and memories you were able to make at that moment. So up until my flight to LAX, I was pretty down. However, as soon as I landed, the energy was just different. The weather was sunny but not burning hot, and the atmosphere was just on a higher amplitude. Los Angeles was filled with culture, and I couldn't wait to start. One of my long-time friends at LAX picked me up, and he was kind enough to get me my first meal and drop me off at De Neve Plaza, where I would be staying this summer.
 
Once I got to UCLA, I met my roommate Saiyang Li. At the time, it was a little awkward, like it always is with new roommates, but now I consider him one of my greatest friends. We walked around UCLA's enormous and gorgeous campus together, and I was at such a loss for words for how fantastic this summer would be. That night I met even more great people at the SPUR pizza dinner, and I knew at this point that summer would be great! I was ecstatic to meet people all over America who shared similar interests to what I liked, which was something so valuable. Usually, friendships stem from similarities, making it easy to speak and get along with them. But the network was just as crazy to me. During these eight weeks, we would be spending much time together. However, once the program finished, the thought of having friends from Puerto Rico, New Jersey, North Carolina, etc., was just crazy. This concept of meeting people around the world was not very new, but it was new for me to meet people around the world with similar interests. Also, a diverse spread of people made it even better.
 
As time progressed, we integrated into our labs and began work, but since I was so happy to be here, it made it feel like I was not working. There was never a day where I dreaded going to "work" because it was just such a healthy work environment. I liked having my desk at Engineering VI because it made me feel like I was a software engineer working for UCLA, a globally recognized institution. We had key cards and assigned server logins, and I felt official during my time here. On top of that, our office space was shared between multiple labs, so a good chunk of us was working in the same area. This made getting lunch together and spending time together on our breaks much better.
 
However, one of my favorite parts about this summer was the events after work. I did not consider myself a social person for most of my life, but I sort of absolutely changed that during my time here. I tried to meet all the bright-minded people and wanted to hear their backgrounds and stories. This was hands down the best thing I did this summer because I got to hear so many perspectives and lifestyles that all work for us. I am proud to say I am nowhere near my final "form," so it was nice to hear about new things from new people constantly. So all this talking and socializing occurred during events planned by us. I made a substantial effort to plan events because I loved the camaraderie. I left my dorm room open to anyone, and almost every night, we would get a group of old and new people to talk about the most random things together. The laughs and memories we shared, even in such simple moments, were invaluable to me.
 
One of my favorite events from the summer was my 21st birthday. 21 is typically a massive year for many college students, and I was super excited to spend it in Los Angeles. My birthday was on a Monday, but that did not stop me from making sure to celebrate properly. After work ended around 5 pm, I got dinner with a few friends at Ami Sushi to start the festivities. After that, I ran a tiny little social event at De Neve, where I shared a toast with all the fantastic people I have met at this summer program. We all shared a glass of champagne, and I was super grateful to have a group of brand-new friends that accepted me so quickly.
 
Some other events we had on the occasion were going to various places across Los Angeles: Venice Beach, Malibu, Downtown LA, etc. Exploring Los Angeles was also just very exciting. My ambition, which I think developed during the summer, pushed me tp explore Los Angeles and what it had to offer. One of my favorite memories of this was going to an LGBTQ+ book store where we were given three free books written by LGBTQ+ authors. I was never really exposed to literature work from these authors, so it just added to the experience of reading their perspectives. It was gratifying to have gone but also to hear the experiences of those within the LGBTQ+ community in this program. I would say a good majority were LGBTQ+ which exposed me to a lot about their community.
 
The last thing I wanted to also write about was the valuable time I spent with Noelle Wheeler. It was safe to say she was my absolute best friend during this program. She did her bachelor's at UCLA, so she knew a lot about the area and had a car. We shared the same lab space at Engineering VI, and to be honest, there was not a moment from the day I met her that we were apart. She was brilliant and just a fun presence to be around. There was not a dull day with her, and she was a big part of my summer. We explored a lot of Los Angeles together, ate lunch together nearly every day, and were just able to develop a lifelong friendship within this short eight-week research program. I was lucky to meet such an incredible person and share much of my summer with her.
 
Well, this turned out to be a lot writing. It is safe to say I still left off a lot of great things, but there is not that much space to write more unless I want to make this blog post into a full-fledged journal. I just wanted to thank whoever allowed me to enter this program because it honestly changed my life. I met the most incredible people, worked on some impactful research, and was **the happiest** I have ever been in my life. These eight weeks went by too fast, and I am just at such a loss for words that it ended so soon. However, I told most of them that this was not the end and that I would travel across the world to see many of them again. I also just wanted to give a special shoutout to all whom I alluded to in this story without actually name-dropping them:
 
- Osagie
- Victoria
- Anna
- Philippa
- Aahna
- Tiffanie

Thanks for making my summer unbelievably unique, and thanks for reading!

## Why La La Land is Such a Great Movie
#### September 22, 2022

This week's blog post is about justifying from my point of view why La La Land is such a good movie. Before I dive deep into my take, I want to mention that Rotten Tomatoes has a rating of 91%. I think nowadays it is hard to name a film with a rating above 90%. Anyhow, this film also took 4 Academy Awards at the Oscars. Those four are the Academy Award for Best Actress, Academy Award for Best Director, Academy Award for Best Original Score, & Academy Award for Best Cinematography. It is safe to say that I endorse all these awards to the highest degree. However, let's dive into the plot and explain why this movie is so fantastic. *Also, spoiler warning if this movie review did not imply that*

### Reason 1: A Genuine Story

My biggest pet peeve about movies is their fictional contrast to our daily lives. In the film, the protaganist often undergo some obstacles, but they usually end up with a happy ending. This makes sense as most movie plots follow the typical "hero's journey," which has been a traditional storytelling method. However, La La Land, the film, does the exact opposite. To many viewers, much of the criticism of the film is due to a lack of a happy ending, so the perspective is pretty subjective when determining the "best movie." However, the parallels to our daily lives have allowed this movie to be relatable, which is one of the primary reasons I am so high on this film.

In a few sentences, I will briefly describe the plot. Our protagonists are Sebastian and Mia, two performing artists who start off doing things they do not want to do. However, both protagonists have their independent dreams: a dream of owning a Jazz bar to continue the dying jazz legacy, and the other wants to be a Hollywood star. The two of them cross paths in this musical journey, pushing each other to chase their pipe dreams. Sebastian enters a new-generation jazz group, and Mia hosts her one-woman show. One succeeds in his endeavors, and the other fails at chasing their dream. However, Sebastian pushes Mia to be resilient, and Mia ultimately gets a lead role in the movie. The two do not end up together, but they pursue their lifelong dreams. 

Now that you are aware of the plot again, I want to dive into my film analysis. As previously mentioned, the movie is very parallel to our own lives. We are all dreamers, but we are often afraid to pursue the things we want to do due to the massive risk of failing. It is a very empathetic feeling. I have often felt this sentiment of not reaching expectations, but I was lucky to be resilient and keep going. Also, the fact that the two do not end up together and live a happily ever after ending is so realistic. Being passionate about chasing your dream comes with sacrifice, and unless you are with someone who shares a similar vision, there will most likely be a divergence between the two people. However, it is safe to say that people can affect chasing the "impossible." In my life, I have met plenty of people who have offered great advice and have given me the confidence to pursue what I want to do. My journey to reaching the current version of myself was filled with obstacles and hardships, but thanks to the many influential mentors and friends, I am where I am in my academic journey.

Last, I think the movie captures the concept of a "pipe dream" perfectly. For those unaware of the phrase, a pipe dream is an unattainable or fanciful hope or scheme. This idea ties back with the film's realism, but it leaves you with inspiration if you are a dreamer. A crazy concept, idea, or goal is only really being held back by yourself. And the film shows the progressive stages of chasing a pipe dream. You can fail miserably or attain the dream you once had. For me, this film has shown me never to give up. Because as soon as you give up, there is no chance for success in the path. This sense of genuinity is the first reason La La Land is a great film.

### Reason 2: Creativity and Aesthetic

This movie won the Academy Award for Best Cinematography for a reason. Not only was the plot great, but the visual demonstration of the plot is another reason the film is so memorable. Los Angeles is an iconic location for Hollywood films, but this movie, in particular, highlights the city of angels in a different light. From the angles to the vibrant colors, this movie is genuinely a masterpiece in cinematography. Movies can often be hard to make because there needs to be a mixture of positive reviews on the plot and the cinematography. For example, a film can have an incredible story, but if the CGI or color grading looks awful, the movie is a flop. The same goes for vice versa. 

Another unique aspect that ties in with the creativity and the aesthetic is how they turn the plot into music. I don't know if you can call this film a musical, but it has every feature a musical entails. Though this may be biased, music is an excellent way of conveying emotions and telling a story, and it's the reason I love the musical aspect of this film. Whether it's the lyrics of City of Stars or the jazz music, it all helps add to its captivating plot. Also, this has nothing to do with the excellent music, but who knew Ryan Gosling's good sing well? To put it into slight words, this film is an artistic masterpiece. It captures small components of what it takes to make a film and transforms it into art. So from my critique, they get plus points for creativity.

### Additional Remarks

While this is a short blog post, I was happy to share my POV about my favorite movie. I will reinstate that this movie does a tremendous job of conveying a realistic message to its viewers, and I hope that you come away feeling a similar sentiment to my movie review. In my free time, I have had lots of time to watch documentaries, TV shows, and movies, and I want to continue sharing media that is worth watching. Thanks for tuning in this week, and I hope you check in again next week.

## The Collatz Conjecture
#### September 14, 2022

Mathematics can most definitely be a headache to many people, including myself. However, it is impossible to evade as almost every field of study uses mathematics as a stepping stone within their field. On the other hand, mathematics is also a subfield of theorems, proofs, and conjectures that can be deemed beautiful. Today I wanted to introduce a problem in mathematics with no intuition. It's been a problem that has long been worked on for many years, yet there is no feasible explanation for why this system occurs the way it does. It is called the **Collatz Conjecture**.
 
The rules are fairly simple, pick any number \\(N\\) and apply these two simple rules. If your number is even (\\(N%2 == 0 \\)) then you divide your current number by 2 (\\(N/2\\)) and if your number is odd (\\(N%2 == 1\\)) you multiply your current number by 3 and add 1 (\\(3N+1\\)). You would think that there would be a positive number that becomes infinite, but this is not the case ever. Every positive integer will end up in a 4-2-1 loop at some point, and no one knows why? Here I have generated a plot that shows the iterations of the first 100,000 numbers on the number scale.
 
{% highlight Python linenos %}
def collatz(n):
   if n == 1:                            
       result = [1]
   elif n % 2 == 0:
       result = collatz(n // 2) + [n]
   elif n % 2 == 1:
       result = collatz((3 * n) + 1) + [n]
   return result
 
runs= N # pick a number here
seen = {}
sequence_lengths=[]
for i in tqdm.tqdm(range(1,runs)):
   length = collatz(i)
   plt.plot(length[::-1])
   sequence_lengths.append(len(length))
plt.title("First N integers within the collatz conjecture")
# plt.yscale('log') - if you want it in log-log scale
# plt.xscale('log') - if you want it in log-log scale
plt.xlabel("iterations")
plt.ylabel("number")
{% endhighlight %}
 
![image-center](/images/post_photos/3.png){: .align-center style="width: 60%;"}
 
In this graph, no number surpasses 350 iterations, and most numbers don't even reach 250 iterations. Suppose we view these numbers at a log-log scale which is *a scale on which the actual distance of a point from the scale zero is proportional to the logarithm of the corresponding scale number rather than the number itself* (Merriam-webster.com). In that case, we see that all numbers have almost the same trend shifted along the x-axis, which is weird. 
 
![image-center](/images/post_photos/4.png){: .align-center style="width: 60%;"}
![image-center](/images/post_photos/5.png){: .align-center style="width: 60%;"}
 
To take it a step further, mathematicians have made a new way to visualize this conjecture where you shift the number anti-clockwise if it's even and clockwise if it is odd. With that, we get a beautiful portrayal of a feather-like structure. This is where I was talking about how beauty is hidden in mathematics.
 
![image-center](/images/post_photos/1.png){: .align-center style="width: 60%;"}
 
This problem remains impossible to prove and has been something we have been told to avoid as mathematicians. Famous mathematician Paul Erdos says, "Mathematics is not yet ripe enough for such questions." Therefore following Paul's words, I wish to not speak any further. I hope you learned something, and I hope you have a good day.

## Life In Europe
#### September 23, 2022

Living in Europe has brought together brand-new experiences and a total cultural shock, even during my second long-term stay. Today I wanted to bring to light some of the downsides of living in Europe from my single perspective. Though there have been many positives, I wanted to highlight some downsides instead. It is safe to say I have taken some critical features for granted. * *Disclaimer I am from California, so this might not be a fair assessment* *
 
One of the few downsides to Europe has been the weather. After living in California for many years, I have taken for granted how nice California can be. Even in September, Switzerland has been rather gloomy and is starting to become cold. While I do prefer colder temperatures over bakingly hot temperatures, I am not very content with the lack of sunshine that I am currently exposed to. I think weather does indeed have some effect on the mental health of a human being.
 
Another downside has been the lack of tall buildings. In Europe, for whatever reason, they lack buildings taller than four stories. It makes every city seem very small, cluttered as well as outdated. I feel like I live in a society 20 years behind the one I just left in America. Everything here has a vintage feel to it. Although it can be cool in historical contexts, it is not ideal in the rest.
 
A third downside has been the general environment the people create. Though I have yet to begin school, I am a little underwhelmed by European society's lack of openness (is this a word?). In America, everyone is rather friendly and whatnot, but I have often gotten cold shoulders from many people in my time here. It has sheltered me in a way and has limited my interactions with people. I am unsure if it is because I am Asian in a predominantly white community, but I feel a little bit out of place. I guess it doesn't help not being able to speak the language. However, I get this general sense of unfriendliness from many people.
 
However, there have been just as many positive experiences, and I am doing well. I begin school a week from today, so I look forward to that. After all, the very reason I came here was so that I could meet all types of scholars from all around the world. I will keep you updated then. Thanks for reading this short passage!

## Introductions
#### September 10, 2022

I am just about ready to launch version 1.0.0 of my website, and so far, I am delighted with the product. Although learning how to set up these free HTML themes was a bit of a headache, I am glad I stuck with it and went all the way.
 
The purpose of starting a blog was that I forgot how much I miss recreational writing. Sometimes writing out your thoughts can be nice for a change. For me, this website is a way of organizing everything I have done in this hectic period in my life. As of late, I feel like I have been on the move constantly doing all types of great things but always used [github.com](https://github.com/Simonlee711) as my "personal website." At last, I have constructed a website!!
 
On top of just blogging occasionally, one of the other features I am excited about is my photo gallery. I have been working hard lately on a design I like, but now I think I got a pretty cool one, and you can view them by clicking [here](https://simonlee711.github.io/photos/).
 
#### What to Expect moving forward
 
I will try to keep an organized grouping of specific types of blogs. Those blogs are:
 
- Life Away From America
 
- Mathematics/Code/Simulations
 
- Reflection on past Experiences
 
Well, I look forward to writing more entries soon. Stay tuned.
