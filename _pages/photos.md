One of my few hobbies is taking an excessive amount of photographs and videos. I currently take non-professional photos on my Iphone and have collected 11,395 photos (as of October 16, 2022) and have even more saved on the Google photos cloud. However one of my early issues I faced was not having a median to be able to share my life experiences. Therefore, I have created this webpage to showcase some of my favorite memories over the years. This will be an ongoing project for me as I will continue to be traveling and taking any opportunities that are presented to me. 

The motivation behind this project is because from time to time, I tend to look back through my photos and just reminisce on all the good memories I was able to share. Holding a connection for super long has been rather challenging for me personally due to how dynamic my life has become. In a way I have started to adapt to a nomadic lifestyle since I have not been home for some time.  Adapting to this new lifestyle has meant that many people are cycling inside and outside of my life. However, that is where the beauty of photography comes in. Photos sort of are a forever type of thing and knowing my own tendencies, I probably took them because it was something I wanted to remember. Being able to look through photos has been an outlet for me to relive some of these moments temporarily. For that reason I cherish this hobby I have taken up and wanted to share them with the friends, colleagues, and future companions I have yet to meet. 

The photos are organized by year. Please do enjoy them as much as I enjoy them myself :)
