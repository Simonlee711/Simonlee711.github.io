One of my few hobbies is taking photographs and videos. Currently on my Iphone 13 Pro, I have 11,002 photos (as of Sept 10, 2022) and even more saved on the Google photos cloud. However I am unable to share all these photos so I have created this webpage to showcase some of my photos over the years. This will be an ongoing project for me as I will continue to be traveling all around the world for the next two years and it may be best to share some of my photos through my webpage. Almost really similar to an instagram feed, this will showcase by year some of the journeys along with a caption of what was going on in the picture.

From time to time, I tend to look back through my photos and just reminisce on all the good memories I was able to share. Holding a connection for super long has been a rather challenge due to how dynamic my life has become. In a way I have started to live in a nomadic way since I have not been home for some time and don't intend to go home for the next two years. Adapting this new nomadic lifestyle has meant that many people are cycling inside and outside of my life but that is where the beauty of photography comes in. Photos sort of last forever and knowing myself, I took them because it was something I wanted to remember. For me looking through photos has been an outlet to relive that moment temporarily. For that reason I cherish the photos I have taken and wanted to share them with the friends, colleagues, and future companions I have yet to meet. 

The photos are organized by year. Please do enjoy them as much as I enjoy them myself :)
