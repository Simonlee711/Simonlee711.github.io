One of my few hobbies is taking an excessive amount of photographs and videos. I currently take non-professional photos on my iPhone. I have collected 13,652 photos (as of February 16, 2023) and have even more saved on the Google photos cloud. While I take many photos for myself, I also wanted to create this page to share some of my favorite memories over the years. This page is to show some of my core memories spent with various people in different places and a nice way to scroll through my years in pictures. Please do enjoy them as much as I enjoy them myself :)
