One of my few hobbies is taking photographs and videos. I currently take non-professional photos on my Iphone 13 Pro where I have 11,002 photos (as of Sept 10, 2022) and even more saved on the Google photos cloud. However I am unable to share all these photos so I have created this webpage to showcase some of my favorite memories over the years. This will be an ongoing project for me as I will continue to be traveling all around the world for the next year or so. 

The motivation behind this project is because from time to time, I tend to look back through my photos and just reminisce on all the good memories I was able to share. Holding a connection for super long has been a rather large challenge for me personally due to how dynamic my life has become. In a way I have started to adapt to a nomadic lifestyle since I have not been home for some time.  Adapting to this new lifestyle has meant that many people are cycling inside and outside of my life. However, that is where the beauty of photography comes in. Photos sort of are a forever thing and knowing my own tendencies, I probably took them because it was something I wanted to remember. Being able to look through photos has been an outlet for me to relive some of these moments temporarily. For that reason I cherish this hobby I have taken up and wanted to share them with the friends, colleagues, and future companions I have yet to meet. 

The photos are organized by year. Please do enjoy them as much as I enjoy them myself :)
