One of my few hobbies is taking excessive photographs and videos. I currently take non-professional photos on my iPhone. I have collected 13,652 photos (as of February 16, 2023) and have even more saved on the Google photos cloud. However, one of the early issues I faced was not having a median to be able to share my life experiences. Therefore, I have created this webpage to showcase some of my favorite memories over the years. This will be an ongoing project for me as I will continue traveling and taking any opportunities presented to me. 

The motivation behind this project is that from time to time, I tend to look back through my photos and just reminisce on all the good memories I was able to share. Holding a connection for super long has been somewhat challenging due to how dynamic my life has become. In a way, I have started to adapt to a nomadic lifestyle since I have not been home for some time. Adapting to this new lifestyle has meant that many people are cycling inside and outside my life. However, that is where the beauty of photography comes in. Photos are a forever type of thing, and knowing my tendencies, I probably took them because it was something I wanted to remember. Being able to look through photos has been an outlet for me to temporarily relive some of these moments. For that reason, I cherish this hobby I have taken up and want to share them with the friends, colleagues, and future companions I have yet to meet. 

The photos are organized by year. Please do enjoy them as much as I enjoy them myself :)
